## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **The process listing reads the read model, so a sharded fleet lists the fleet.** It queried the
  write-side database of whichever shard served the request, so *Workflow → Processes* showed one
  shard and no others — while the guide said the read model was what let a question span shards.
  It does now: with `workflow.projection.enabled` on, the listing pages, filters and orders against
  `process_index`, in both the JPA store and the JDBC one a remote projector deployment reads
  through. Off, it uses the write side exactly as before.

  This needed the process's **name** in the index, which `ProcessStatusChanged` did not carry: the
  listing shows it and searches by it, and an index without it would have answered a different
  question depending on which store answered. The event, the row, the two stores and the shard
  backfill all carry it now; `V3__process_index_name.sql` adds the column. Rows projected earlier
  have none and fall back to the business key rather than rendering a blank — a backfill fills them
  in.

## [2.7.0] - 2026-08-21

**`/workflow/analytics` did not return.** The request thread entered the route and never logged
again; the pod missed three liveness probes and was SIGKILLed. It was never the database —
PostgreSQL did the whole join in 247 ms — it was 383 215 rows materialised on the request thread to
put about fifty on a page.

Minor rather than patch: this changes the shape of the two repository ports. Anything implementing
`ProcessRepository` or `StepExecutionRepository` outside this repository inherits the new methods
as defaults and keeps working, but the interfaces are wider than they were.

### Changed
- **Analytics is aggregated by the database instead of folded in the JVM.** `/workflow/analytics`
  did not return: the request thread entered the route and never logged again, and the pod missed
  three liveness probes and was SIGKILLed. It was never the database — PostgreSQL did the whole join
  in 247 ms — it was 383 215 rows materialised on the request thread to put about fifty on a page.
  Every field of the report is a `GROUP BY`, so the two repository ports gained aggregate methods:
  the JPA store answers them in SQL, the in-memory store folds rows exactly as before, because
  memory mode is small by construction and that is what it is for. Measured on 20 000 processes and
  100 000 step executions against real PostgreSQL: **140 ms against 646 ms** row by row, and the
  reduction now returns tens of rows rather than hundreds of thousands. The `p95` stays a measured
  sample rather than an interpolation — `percentile_disc` in SQL is the same nearest-rank rule the
  Java implementation always applied, and an equivalence test holds the two to the same numbers.

## [2.6.2] - 2026-08-21

A deployment could not write a form execution at all — eleven columns were `varchar(255)` wherever
Hibernate built the schema, because the mappings declared no length and the migrations, which said
`TEXT`, never ran there. Reported from the sagas PoC, where a saga's variables are several kilobytes
and the task never reached the person waiting for it.

Also here: the graph browser journeys that had been failing at random on unrelated branches, and a
Mateu bump.

### Changed
- **Mateu 3.0-alpha.298.** A plain dependency bump. Verified rather than read off the release: the
  browser suite was run against it in full — 25 journeys — alongside the engine, forms and worker
  suites. Nothing it carries is visible here.

### Fixed
- **The graph browser journeys failed at random, on branches that touched nothing near the graph.**
  The page object read the graph's shadow DOM without checking it was attached yet, and the retry
  loop around it propagates an exception where it would have retried a false condition. Twice in one
  afternoon, on a listings change and on a persistence change.

- **Eleven columns were `varchar(255)` wherever Hibernate built the schema, and a real deployment
  could not write a form execution at all.** Reported from the sagas PoC:

      value too long for type character varying(255)
        ... insert into form_execution_entity (..., variables, ...)

  so the task never reached the person it was waiting for and the step timed out instead.

  None of these fields declared a length, so Hibernate mapped each to `varchar(255)` — narrower than
  the migrations intended in every case, and narrower than the content in several. It only bites
  where Hibernate builds the schema rather than Flyway, which is exactly how the demo and the PoC
  run (`ddl-auto=update`, migrations off), and it was invisible from the other side: the migrations
  had said `TEXT` all along.

  | entity | column | migration said | Hibernate built |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | `FormExecutionEntity` | `variables`, `values` | `TEXT` | `varchar(255)` |
  | `FieldEntity` | `options`, `optionsSource` | `TEXT` | `varchar(255)` |
  | `FieldEntity`, `FormEntity` | `description` | `VARCHAR(1024)` | `varchar(255)` |
  | `StepEntity` | `variables` | `VARCHAR(2048)` | `varchar(255)` |
  | `StepEntity` | `precondition`, `description` | `VARCHAR(1024)` | `varchar(255)` |
  | `LogMessageEntity` | `message` | `VARCHAR(2048)` | `varchar(255)` |
  | `ResourceEntity` | `url` | `VARCHAR(1024)` | `varchar(255)` |

  Both halves now say `TEXT`, so it no longer matters which one builds the schema. The migrations
  widen the capped columns to match rather than the mappings adopting their caps: in PostgreSQL
  `varchar(n)` and `text` are the same storage and the same speed, so a length on a JSON document,
  a log message or a URL buys nothing and costs an insert that fails in production. Widening is
  metadata-only there — no table rewrite, no long lock.

### Added
- **A test for the shape of this bug, in the one form that can fail.** The obvious test — save
  several kilobytes, read them back — is worthless here: **H2 does not enforce `VARCHAR` length**,
  so it passes against a 255-character column holding 2 KB. Verified rather than assumed, by
  reverting a mapping and watching the round trip stay green while `information_schema` reported
  `len=255`. That is the same blind spot that let this ship. The tests assert the *declared width*
  instead, which H2 reports faithfully even though it will not police it, and both were checked to
  discriminate: reverting a mapping fails exactly the column reverted.

## [2.6.1] - 2026-08-20

One fix, and the page it fixes is the one 2.6.0 was cut for. Analytics stopped killing the pod in
2.6.0 and started returning 500 instead, on every PostgreSQL deployment and for every window —
reported from a real deployment within hours of the release, reproduced, and covered by a test in
the suite that has a real database.

### Fixed
- **Analytics returned 500 on PostgreSQL, for every window.** Both analytics projections bound
  their window with the usual optional-parameter shape,
  `(:createdFrom is null or p.created >= :createdFrom)`. Hibernate emits a *separate* placeholder
  per occurrence of a named parameter, so what reaches the database is
  `(? is null or pe1_0.created >= ?)` and `$1` appears nowhere except in `$1 is null` — nothing to
  infer a type from, and PostgreSQL refuses to prepare the statement: `42P18, could not determine
  data type of parameter $1`. Casting the null check gives it the type back. Because the failure is
  at prepare time it did not depend on the values, so `/workflow/analytics` was broken with a window
  set exactly as it was without one — 2.6.0 turned a page that killed the pod into a page that
  always 500s.

  It survived release because nothing exercised these two queries against PostgreSQL: the engine's
  own tests run on H2, which infers the type happily and returns rows, and the service test above
  them mocks the repositories. The regression test is `Dist15AnalyticsWindowTest`, in the suite that
  has a real database — verified to discriminate, three failures with the cast removed, all of them
  the 42P18 above.

### Documentation
- **The test worker, driven from a deployment rather than a test.** The guide stated a scenario and
  then only ever started the process from JUnit, so the half of the audience holding a running
  cluster had no route in: the orchestrator UI, the `TEST_CONFIG` variable on a
  `ProcessCreationRequested`, and the escaping that a JSON-inside-a-string demands. Two failure modes
  are now written down and told apart — an event whose own JSON is broken never becomes an event at
  all, creates no process, is not parked in the dead-letter store because conversion fails before any
  handler runs, and leaves the producer exiting 0; a broken `TEST_CONFIG` *string* inside a valid
  event fails loudly on the process instead. Also documented: this worker and the forms engine both
  bind `downstream` out of the box, so the worker answers `USER_TASK`s meant for people until the
  human steps are given a topic of their own.

## [2.6.0] - 2026-08-20

**The admin UI read every row of the write side to paint ten of them**, and on the demo deployment
that had stopped being a slow page and become an outage: opening `/workflow/analytics` killed the
orchestrator pod.

Four pages shared one habit — load the whole table through the domain aggregate, then filter, sort
and paginate in Java. A process row carries its workflow definition JSON, 8 KB on average, so ten
rows cost 315 MB out of Postgres on every keystroke. Analytics was the same habit at a worse scale:
every process, plus the entire step-execution table re-read once per workflow definition, around
2.5 GB for one page. Two real requests: 61 s abandoned by the browser, and 38 s returning HTTP 500
with the pod SIGKILLed at that moment.

Everything below was measured against 37 651 processes and 345 564 step executions, not estimated.
The listings and analytics now read projections of the columns they actually show, page in SQL, and
answer in milliseconds.

### Changed
- **Mateu 3.0-alpha.297.** A plain dependency bump. Verified rather than assumed: the browser suite
  was run against it in full — 25 journeys, including the graph readability ones — alongside the
  engine and worker suites, and nothing it carries is visible here.

The admin UI read every row of the write side to paint ten of them. Four pages, one habit: load the
whole table through the domain aggregate, then filter, sort and paginate in Java. On the demo
deployment — 37 651 processes, 345 564 step executions — that was measured, not estimated.

### Fixed
- **Analytics did not just take a minute, it took the pod down.** `/workflow/analytics` loaded every
  process and then re-read the entire `step_execution_entity` table **once per workflow definition**
  — six times, step JSON and variables included. Around 2.5 GB of row data for one page. Two real
  requests: 61.3 s, abandoned by the browser; 38.5 s, HTTP 500. The orchestrator was SIGKILLed at
  the moment of the second (`exitCode: 137`), and the gateway then returned 500 on `/workflow/steps`
  because there was nothing behind it.

  Both ports gained an analytics projection (`findAnalyticsRows`) reading the seven and six columns
  the report actually uses, and the service now takes **one** snapshot per report instead of one
  re-read per definition — step executions are indexed by process once, so per-definition work is a
  lookup rather than a scan of the whole table. The window goes into the query, and step executions
  join their process so it narrows them too.

  Every number is unchanged: nearest-rank p95, averages, per-day throughput, the bottleneck flag and
  the flow ordering of steps are all still computed in Java over the same values. Measured on the
  same data: 6.5 MB + 36.6 MB instead of 315 MB + 6 × 360 MB, and 0.25 s of database work.

### Changed
- **The process and step listings page in SQL.** `SimpleProcessCrudAdapter.search` and
  `StepExecutionsCrudAdapter.search` called `findAll()` and paged the result in Java. A process row
  carries its workflow definition JSON — 8 KB on average — so painting ten rows moved 315 MB out of
  Postgres, on every keystroke in the search box and every page turn. Measured on the demo: 6.9 s,
  7.2 s, 7.6 s of server time to return between 454 and 6 111 bytes.

  Filtering, ordering and paging now happen in the store, over a projection of the columns the table
  shows — never `workflow_definition_json`, `variables`, `log` or `step_json`. The in-memory store
  keeps the old behaviour as the port's default; only the JPA store overrides it.

  With the new indexes the unfiltered listing is an index scan of twelve buffers, 0.047 ms.

- **Paging is one contract, in one place.** The page size and number a listing reports are decided
  by the store now (`ServedPage`), so the SQL and in-memory paths cannot drift: a size of zero or
  less still means everything on one page, and a page past the end is still answered with the last
  real one. Pushed down, that last part cannot be clamped after the fact — the store has to count
  before it knows which page exists — so it counts first and then asks for the page it can serve.

- **Received tasks page in the database too.** The test worker's listing went through mateu's
  default `CrudStore.find`, which is `findAll()` paged in memory: 64 006 rows for ten, 1.6–2.2 s.
  `JpaReceivedTaskStore` now overrides it. Text search is pushed down replicating mateu's own rule
  exactly — every whitespace-separated token must appear in the row's `toString()`. The filter form
  and column criteria are deliberately **not** reimplemented: their semantics live in private
  reflection inside `CrudStore`, so those paths still delegate to the default.

- **The demo shell compresses and lets its bundle be cached.** 3.5 MB of JavaScript went out
  uncompressed, under `Cache-Control: no-store` — Spring Security's default headers applied to
  `/assets/**`, so the cache was not missing, it was forbidden. Compression is on (817 KB, 4.3×) and
  a dedicated filter chain drops only the cache-control writer for static paths, leaving every other
  security header in place. The bundle revalidates rather than expiring, because these filenames
  carry no content hash and a long `max-age` would strand browsers on an old bundle after a release;
  a second load is now six 304s and no bytes. The bootstrap HTML stays uncached.

### Added
- **Indexes for the two listings** (`V22`, `V23`): `created` and `(status, created)` on
  `process_entity`, `started_at` on `step_execution_entity`. Each is declared `DESC NULLS LAST` to
  match the queries exactly — both columns are nullable, and a plain `DESC` index in Postgres is
  `NULLS FIRST`, which would leave the planner sorting anyway.
## [2.5.1] - 2026-08-20

Mateu 3.0-alpha.296, and nothing else. It compiles clean and changes nothing observable — cut so a
deployment can pin one version rather than a version plus a note about what is not in it.

Measured rather than read off the release: the three operator journeys that wait on a view model's
`@Toolbar` actions being rendered were enabled and run against it, and the toolbar still offers two
of the five declared. They stay disabled.

### Changed
- **Mateu 3.0-alpha.296.** A plain dependency bump: it compiles clean, and nothing it carries is
  visible here. Measured rather than read off the release — the three operator journeys that wait on
  a view model's `@Toolbar` actions being rendered were enabled and run against it, and the toolbar
  still offers two of the five it declares, so they stay disabled.

## [2.5.0] - 2026-08-20

Three defects that shared a failure mode: **the system said yes and did nothing.**

Tracing was configured, enabled, and exported not a single span — 2.3.0 had fixed the missing
auto-configuration, so a `Tracer` existed and the tests written for it passed, in CI and in the
image, while no trace ever reached a collector. The endpoint was set under a property Boot 4
deprecated at level *error*, which means it is no longer bound: it reads back perfectly from the
environment, nothing consumes it, and the exporter that depends on it is never created. Spans were
built by a real tracer, handed to a real processor, and dropped.

The test worker's `memory` profile — the one the guide recommends for CI — did not start at all,
and under `jpa` it ran tasks one at a time while looking concurrent on paper. Those two are one
problem seen twice: `memory` was the configuration in which the concurrency premise held, and the
one that would not run, so there was no shape in which this worker could be driven at load.

None of the three showed up as an error anywhere. That is what the tests added with them are for: a
span exporter bean, a context that starts under the profile, and a store call slow enough that
serialising it is visible.

### Fixed
- **Tracing was configured, enabled, and exported nothing.** 2.3.0 fixed the missing
  auto-configuration, so a `Tracer` was created and the two tests written for it passed — in CI and
  in the image. No span ever reached a collector, and nothing said why.

  The endpoint was set under `management.otlp.tracing.endpoint`, which Boot 4 deprecated at level
  **error**: the property is no longer bound, and the metadata entry survives only to say so. It
  reads back perfectly from the environment, so everything looked configured. What depends on it is
  the OTLP exporter bean, which was therefore never created — spans were built by a real tracer,
  handed to a real span processor, and dropped for want of anything to export them with.

  Now set under `management.opentelemetry.tracing.export.otlp.endpoint`, in all three apps that
  trace. `OTLP_TRACING_ENDPOINT` is unchanged, so no deployment has to move.

  The test asserts the **exporter bean exists**, which is the half nobody was asserting: a `Tracer`
  without an exporter is a tracing setup that passes every check and reports nothing. Reading the
  property back would have proved only that the yaml says what the yaml says — which is exactly
  what made this look right for two releases.

- **The worker's `memory` profile did not start.** The profile is documented as the shape a CI suite
  wants — one container, no volume — and it failed on an `entityManagerFactory` it had deliberately
  removed. The stores are conditional; the Spring Data repository interfaces they wrap are not and
  cannot be, because scanning is what finds them, and the application class turned scanning on
  unconditionally. Excluding the JPA auto-configurations does not help: excluding an
  auto-configuration does not stop repository scanning. `@EnableJpaRepositories` and `@EntityScan`
  now sit on a configuration conditional on `worker.persistence=jpa`, which is what the stores
  already switch on. A context test starts the profile, which is the only size of test that could
  have caught this — every unit in the worker was fine; the assembly was not.

- **The test worker did not run tasks concurrently under `jpa`.** The consumer uses `flatMap` and
  the simulator uses `Mono.delay`, so on paper it ran many at once. The store calls are blocking,
  and they were made on the Reactor thread carrying the task — a considered trade whose premise was
  that they interleave with a `delay` and starve nothing. True of the in-memory map, false of JPA,
  where the blocking call is a database round trip on the same small pool every other task shares.
  Measured at 5,000 processes against a deployed engine: 7.7 tasks/s at 200ms of simulated work
  each — about 1.5 genuinely in flight, with the worker at 50m CPU and PostgreSQL at 106m and one
  active connection. The store calls now run on `Schedulers.boundedElastic()`. The test puts the
  delay in the store, which is where JPA puts it: 0.6s with the fix, 1.8s without.

  Together these were the whole of it — `memory` was the configuration where the premise held and
  the one that would not start, so there was no shape in which this worker could be driven at load.


## [2.4.0] - 2026-08-20

The process diagram stops lying, rules stop being the odd one out, and an extension that existed
only on paper becomes real.

**The diagram an operator was watching was frozen** as of the moment the tab opened, for the life of
the tab, while the process ran to completion behind it. Nothing looked broken — every node was still
drawn, in the state it had on opening; only the colours were a lie, which is how it survived months
of use. It had a workaround that could not be shipped, because it traded the frozen diagram for a
status badge that lied about whether an operator's pause or cancel had taken effect. Mateu
3.0-alpha.294 supplied what was missing, and the fix here is to stop writing the graph as component
metadata and let it travel as what it is: data.

**`.ecrule` was declared in two lists and read by nothing** — so since 2.3.0 a build validated a
file the engine would then not load. Green light for something that does not work is worse than
either supporting the extension or refusing it. It is supported now, in the engine and in both IDE
plugins.

The cause of that was structural, and is fixed with it: workflows and forms each have one place that
decides what a definition file is, and rules did not. They do now — which also means **rules can be
imported from a directory**, as the other two already could.

### Added
- **Rules can be imported from a directory**, as workflows and forms already could:
  `rules.directory-import.directories`. This is where the drift above came from — workflows and
  forms each have one `ImportXFromDirectoryUseCase` that decides what a definition file is, and
  their Git imports delegate to it; rules had no such place, so their Git import carried its own
  walk, its own filter and its own parser. Now they have one too, and the Git import delegates. The
  next extension is added in one place rather than three.

### Changed
- **Mateu 3.0-alpha.295.** Carries the element-interpolation support that 294 introduced, and
  compiles clean — unlike 294, which moved `RestDataSource`. Still open upstream: a view model's
  `@Toolbar` actions are not all rendered (two of five), which is why three operator journeys stay
  disabled.
- **The process diagram follows the process again.** A page that refreshes itself answers with a
  `State`, which carries values and deliberately does not resend the component tree — and an
  `Element`'s attributes are part of that tree. So the diagram an operator was watching was frozen
  as of the moment the tab opened, for the life of the tab, while the process ran to completion
  behind it. Nothing looked broken: every node was still drawn, in the state it had on opening. Only
  the colours were a lie.

  Mateu 3.0-alpha.294 added what was missing — an element's attributes and content now accept
  `${...}` expressions, evaluated against the state — so the fix here is to stop writing the graph
  into metadata. The topology and the overlay are two plain `String` fields on the view model, which
  is what makes them data, and the attributes merely say where to read them. The update is applied
  in place, so the element repaints without being rebuilt and keeps its zoom, its selection and its
  computed layout.

  It had a workaround that could not be shipped: returning the view model instead of a `State` made
  the diagram follow the process and stopped the status badge updating, so an operator got a badge
  that lied about whether their pause or cancel had taken effect. The engine shipped the frozen
  diagram rather than that, and `DiagramStaysLiveJourneyTest` sat disabled carrying both
  measurements. It is enabled and passing, and so are the two operator journeys the workaround broke.

  The topology travels this way too, not only the overlay: a DYNAMIC step injects nodes while the
  process runs, so the graph's shape changes under a page that is already open.

### Fixed
- **`.ecrule` was a ghost extension.** It was declared in the engine's shared extension list and in
  the Maven plugin's copy of that list — which 2.3.0 fixed the validator to honour — and read by
  nothing: not the rule import, not either IDE plugin. So a build validated a file the engine would
  then not load, which is worse than either supporting the extension or refusing it: it gives green
  light to something that does not work.

  Both lists even met inside one call — the rule import handed its own three-extension filter to
  `DerivedIds.declaredUnder`, whose own list has six, so an id could be derived for a file the
  filter beside it would never let through.

  `.ecrule` is now read by the rule import and registered by both IDE plugins (VS Code 0.1.14,
  IntelliJ 0.1.15) as YAML with the rule schema attached. There is no visual rule editor and this
  does not pretend otherwise — what a `.ecrule` gets is highlighting, completion and validation
  against the schema the engine validates it with.


## [2.3.0] - 2026-08-20

A minor release: the process diagram answers a question it could not answer before, and two things
that were quietly answering nothing now answer properly.

The diagram numbers its steps in the order the run actually took. A workflow's shape is not a list
of what happened in it — branches drawn side by side ran in some order, a step drawn between two
others may have run before both — so the tick said a step ran and nothing said when. And the
conditions on the lines stopped hiding the steps they apply to: shorter, whole under the pointer,
and placed clear of the nodes.

The two that answered nothing are of a kind. `eventconductor:validate` collected only three of the
six extensions the engine imports, so a repository written by the editors was walked, nothing was
found, and the build passed — a validator that validates nothing looks exactly like one with
nothing to complain about. And an END step recorded no time at all, which read as a step that never
ran wherever the record is shown by time.

Both IDE plugins are rebuilt on the current graph — **VS Code 0.1.13, IntelliJ 0.1.14** — because
each ships its own copy of the component and a rebuild is the only thing that moves it.


### Added
- **The process diagram numbers its steps.** A node now carries its place in the order the run
  actually took, bottom-left, beside the tick that says it ran at all. The shape of a workflow does
  not answer "when": branches drawn side by side ran in some order, a step drawn between two others
  may have run before both, and one drawn on the path may have been skipped. A step that has not had
  its turn carries no number, which is as much part of the reading as the numbers are.

### Changed
- **The IDE plugins ship the current graph: VS Code 0.1.13, IntelliJ 0.1.14.** Both carry their own
  copy of `workflow-graph.js`, synced from the engine at build time and not tracked, so a change to
  the component reaches them only when they are rebuilt — and the published 0.1.12 / 0.1.13 predate
  the guard chips and the step numbers. Verified by unpacking the artifacts rather than by trusting
  the sync: the marks are in the bundle inside both, and were absent from the ones before.

- **Conditions on the lines no longer hide the steps they apply to.** A guard chip is drawn over its
  edge, which is right — it belongs to the way in, not to the step. But an expression is as long as
  its author needed it to be, and drawn in full it can be wider than the nodes it sits between. Two
  things now: the chip shows the first 16 characters and expands to the whole expression under the
  pointer, and it is placed clear of the nodes and of the other chips — searched along its own line
  first, since a chip that moved along its line is still obviously that line's, and only then
  stepped perpendicular to it. Pinned by a browser test that compares the drawn boxes; without the
  search, the fixture's chip covers two nodes.

- **Mateu 3.0-alpha.294.** Creating a task override in the browser works again: the null-numeric
  hang — three nullable numeric fields rendering as `vaadin-integer-field`, a null arriving as
  `NaN`, the field clearing itself and the clear counting as a change — is fixed upstream. The
  guide's caution is gone and `NewOverrideFormJourneyTest`, written as the reproduction, is enabled
  and passing.

  `RestDataSource` grew a `ref` component in this version, so the forms task page builds it by name
  rather than by position; a positional constructor turns every such addition into a compile error
  at best and a silently shifted argument at worst.

  The **process diagram is still frozen** in a page that refreshes itself, and re-measured rather
  than assumed: an `Element`'s attributes still do not travel in a `State` update, so it is the same
  trade as on 291 and 293 — `new State(loaded)` keeps the status badge correct and the diagram
  stale, returning the view model does the opposite and fails two operator journeys on the badge.
  The disabled test carries both measurements. Same for the toolbar rendering two of a view model's
  five `@Toolbar` actions, which is why three operator journeys stay disabled.

### Fixed
- **The Maven plugin validated nothing in a repository written by the editors.** `eventconductor:validate`
  collected only `*.json`, `*.yaml` and `*.yml`, and the graph editor and both IDE plugins write
  `.ec`, `.ecform` and `.ecrule` — which the engine imports without complaint. Pointing the goal at
  a directory of them walked the tree, found no files, and passed: a validator that validates
  nothing is indistinguishable from one with nothing to complain about. Verified against the
  published 2.2.2, not only a local build. It now collects all six, and reads anything that is not
  `.json` with the YAML parser, which reads JSON too — so an `.ec` holding either parses.

- **An END step recorded no time at all.** It is completed straight from the orchestrator's end
  transition, which never went through the path that stamps `finishedAt`, so the one execution that
  by definition ran last was the one with nothing to say when — against what the field itself
  documents. It read as a step that never ran wherever the record is shown by time.

## [2.2.2] - 2026-08-19

A patch release for five defects found by running 2.2.1 in a real Kubernetes deployment, and four
of the five failed the same way: **by doing nothing, quietly**. Tracing that traced nothing because
no `Tracer` was ever created; a Prometheus endpoint that answered 404 because exposing an endpoint
is not the same as having one; a `directory` setting that relaxed binding accepted and nothing read;
and a malformed message dropped without a log line, a dead letter, or a metric. Nothing was broken
in a way that shows: each one looked exactly like a working system with nothing to do.

The fifth was the opposite — it did too much, inserting another copy of every definition file that
declared no `id`, on every import, without bound.

The lesson is in the tests rather than the fixes. Each one now has a test that fails without it,
because every one of these could return the same way it arrived: by a dependency moving, a property
being renamed, or a default changing under us, with nothing to say so.

### Fixed
- **An unreadable message was dropped in complete silence.** A record whose bytes could not be
  turned into an event — JSON that does not parse, a `type` this version does not know — never
  reached a handler, so none of the engine's handling applied to it. Spring Cloud Stream's converter
  failed, and the binder's default helper answers "do not fail" and then does nothing but re-align
  the `kafka_*` header lists. The record was dropped, the batch committed and the offset advanced:
  no log line at any level, no dead letter, no metric, lag back to zero.

  That combination is undiagnosable from outside, which is what makes it worse than the failure
  itself. A producer that sent 1,500 malformed messages saw a healthy engine that had created
  nothing — indistinguishable from messages that never arrived, so the search starts at the
  producer, then the topic, then the consumer group, and the payload is the last thing anyone looks
  at.

  Such a record is now logged at ERROR with an excerpt of the payload and the reason it could not be
  read — derived by re-reading the bytes, because the batch hook is handed no cause at all and
  "could not be converted" without saying why is most of the way back to silence. It is parked on
  the `dead-letter` topic as the original bytes, with `x-dead-letter-unreadable: true`, and counted
  by `eventconductor.events.dead.lettered`.

  It is still skipped rather than retried: bytes that cannot be parsed now cannot be parsed on
  redelivery either, so failing the batch would stall the partition for every process behind it, for
  ever. What changed is that the skip says so. DIST-14 drives it through a real broker and asserts
  both halves — the record is parked, and the records around it still finish.

- **A definition file with no `id` was duplicated on every import.** The importers gave such a file
  a fresh `UUID.randomUUID()` each time, so nothing connected the definition an import created to the
  one the previous import had created from that same file: every import inserted another copy, and
  none of them could be pruned — the code said so itself, tracking only explicit ids for pruning.
  With a git webhook wired up, every push added a copy, without bound, and nothing warned. All three
  engines did it: workflows, forms, and rules (through `SaveRuleUseCase`, which generates an id, as
  it should for a rule somebody saves in the UI and should not for a file).

  Such a file now gets an id **derived from its path** relative to the scan root —
  `sagas/onboarding.ec` becomes `sagas.onboarding`, dots rather than slashes because an id travels
  in URLs and in event payloads. The property that matters is that it is the same next time, which
  is exactly what reconciliation and pruning needed, and both now work for these files.

  Two consequences, chosen rather than incurred: **moving or renaming a file is a delete plus a
  create** (the old path is pruned, the new one arrives new), and the id is relative to the scan
  root, so changing `directory` changes the ids of files that declare none. A definition that must
  survive a move should declare an `id` — that is what declaring one is for.

  An explicit `id` still wins and a derived one never takes it: the ids a scan declares are read
  before anything is imported, because the collision is one of order — the file declaring the id may
  be walked second, and by then the derived one would already have been saved over it. A file whose
  path collides is reported as an error and skipped.

  **Upgrading:** definitions already inserted under generated UUIDs are attributable to no file, so
  the upgrade cannot clean them up. The next import creates one stable definition per file and
  leaves the old copies where they are; archive or delete them once, by hand. After that the count
  stays put.

- **Distributed tracing did nothing at all.** The orchestrator, forms and rule apps declared
  `micrometer-tracing-bridge-otel` and `opentelemetry-exporter-otlp`, and their yaml mapped
  `TRACING_SAMPLING` and `OTLP_TRACING_ENDPOINT` — but those are the OpenTelemetry *libraries*, and
  what creates a `Tracer` from them is Spring Boot's tracing *auto-configuration*, which Boot 4
  split out of `spring-boot-starter-actuator` into its own module. Nothing on the classpath owned
  either property, no `Tracer` bean was created, `WorkflowTracingAutoConfiguration` resolved its
  provider to nothing, and every call ran untraced.

  It failed silently in both directions, which is why it shipped: relaxed binding accepts a
  property nobody owns without complaint, and the engine's tracing bridge is designed to degrade to
  a no-op rather than refuse to start. A deployment setting `TRACING_SAMPLING=1.0` got no spans and
  no error.

  Fixed by adding `spring-boot-micrometer-tracing-opentelemetry`, which brings
  `spring-boot-micrometer-tracing` with it, so one dependency owns both properties. The existing
  names keep working — Boot 4 also offers `management.opentelemetry.tracing.export.otlp.endpoint`,
  but `management.otlp.tracing.endpoint` is still bound, so no deployment has to change. Each of the
  three apps has a test asserting an OpenTelemetry-backed `Tracer` is really there, because nothing
  would have caught its return.

- **The worker and projector answered 404 on `/actuator/prometheus`.** Both list `prometheus` in
  `management.endpoints.web.exposure.include` and neither declared `micrometer-registry-prometheus`.
  Exposure is a permission, not a creation: with no registry on the classpath the endpoint does not
  exist, and naming one you have no implementation for is accepted in silence.

  Anything scraping those pods had a target that was permanently down, which is worse than no
  target — it is an alert about the wrong thing. The other three apps declared the registry all
  along, so this was an omission rather than a decision. Each of the two now has a test that scrapes
  the endpoint over HTTP and asserts it answers with metrics, rather than looking for a registry
  bean: the bean is not the promise.

- **`directory` was accepted and silently ignored by the forms and rule engines.** The workflow
  engine's `GitImportProperties.GitRepository` has a `directory` field, so
  `WORKFLOW_GITIMPORT_REPOSITORIES_0_DIRECTORY` scopes the scan to a subdirectory of the clone. The
  forms and rule copies of that class did not, so their equivalents were accepted by relaxed
  binding — which never complains about a property nobody owns — and changed nothing.

  Pointed at a repository that is not exclusively definitions, both engines walked the entire clone:
  a parse error per unrelated YAML file, and — the real risk — anything that happened to look like a
  definition imported as one.

  Both now carry the field and the `resolveScanRoot` / `pruneKey` handling their workflow
  counterpart already had, including the guard that refuses a directory escaping the repository
  root. That guard matters more than its size: the root it resolves against is the throwaway clone
  the import deletes afterwards, so a `directory: ../..` that normalised instead of being refused
  would walk, prune against, and then delete whatever it found outside.

  Three copies of one properties class is what produced this, and they are still three.

### Notes
- **Known issue: `/_worker/taskOverrides/new` hangs the browser.** Mateu renders `TaskOverride`'s
  three nullable numeric fields — `durationMs`, `failuresBeforeSuccess`, `replyTimes` — as
  `vaadin-integer-field`, and a null arrives as `NaN`: the field clears itself, the clear counts as
  a change, and it is set again, without end.

  Isolated both ways on Mateu 3.0-alpha.291: making those three fields primitive opens the form,
  restoring them hangs it again. Not worked around, because the nullability *is* the meaning —
  `durationMs` null means "inherit from `default`" and `0` means "finish instantly", and a primitive
  cannot express the first.

  Until it is fixed, create overrides through the API or in the `task_override` table. Everything
  else on both worker pages works. The guide says so, and a disabled browser test carries the
  reproduction and passes against a build with those fields made primitive.

## [2.2.1] - 2026-08-19

A patch release, and every entry is something that shipped broken in 2.2.0 or earlier. Two of them
were invisible until something was finally pointed at them: a feature that could not answer a
request, and an image whose vulnerabilities nothing had ever scanned.

### Fixed
- **The worker image shipped four CRITICAL CVEs, and 2.2.0 published it anyway.** The worker was
  the only one of the five standalone apps missing both halves of what keeps the others clean: it
  parented off `spring-boot-starter-parent` **4.0.4** while orchestrator, forms, rules and projector
  are on 4.0.7, and it declared none of the security overrides they each carry. So it went out with
  `tomcat-embed-core` 11.0.18 (three CRITICAL), `jackson` 2.21.1 and `micrometer-core` 1.16.4 —
  25 HIGH and 4 CRITICAL in total, every one of them transitive.

  Neither absence was deliberate. That pom predates the app being published as an image, and until
  2.2.0 added it to the release workflow nothing had ever scanned it: the image had been pushed by
  hand, unscanned, for months. Adding the scan is what found this, on its first run.

  Now aligned with the other four — parent 4.0.7 and the same overrides — and verified with Trivy
  against the built image, with the flags the workflow uses: 0 findings, in the Alpine base and in
  the jar. **`worker-standalone-app:2.2.0` and the `latest` it moved should be treated as
  vulnerable and replaced by this release.**

- **Git webhooks never worked in a released build.** Every `POST` to
  `/workflow/webhooks/{provider}`, `/forms/webhooks/{provider}` or `/rules/webhooks/{provider}`
  answered 500 with `Name for argument of type [java.lang.String] not specified`, before the
  signature was verified and whatever the payload said. The three controllers declare `provider`
  as a bare `@PathVariable String`, so Spring binds it by parameter name — and the reactor
  compiled without `-parameters`, so no `MethodParameters` attribute reached any jar it published.
  There is no Spring Boot parent here to switch that on, and configuring `maven-compiler-plugin`
  at all is what silenced javac's own default, so the omission was invisible: the feature was
  documented, unit-tested and shipped, and the only thing it could not do was answer a request.

  The unit tests could not have caught it. They call `controller.webhook(...)` as a plain object,
  which is the right shape for the routing and verification logic but never reaches the mapping
  layer, and the mapping layer is the whole of the bug. There is now a MockMvc test for the
  workflow engine's webhook that goes through the dispatcher, so the flag cannot be lost silently
  again.

  Fixed for the class rather than the three sites: `<parameters>true</parameters>` on the root
  pom's compiler plugin, which is what the Boot parent would have contributed.

### Changed
- **The release scans its images before publishing them, not after.** The five images were pushed
  as they were built and scanned afterwards, which makes the scan a report rather than a gate —
  2.2.0 published all five and *then* failed on the worker's CVEs, so the bad image was on Docker
  Hub under both its version tag and `latest`, and the projector's scan never ran at all because
  the failing step skipped it. Each image is now built into the runner's daemon, all five are
  scanned, and only then are they pushed — in a single step, because five push steps failing
  part-way through would leave exactly the half-published state this ordering exists to prevent.

  Maven Central still publishes before any image is built, so a failing scan still leaves a
  published version behind on the immutable side. That is a separate decision, not an oversight.

### Notes
- `forms-engine` rose from 44.0% line coverage to 75.7%, and `rule-engine` from 42.8% to 75.8%,
  with their floors raised to match. Nothing was chosen to move a number: the classes covered are
  the adapters at each engine's edge — the JPA repositories, the Kafka consumer, the MCP tools, the
  REST and gRPC read APIs, and the Git import — each the only implementation of a contract somebody
  else depends on, and each at or near zero. `TESTING.md` records the figures and what they mean.

## [2.2.0] - 2026-08-19

A release about what a definition can say, and how it reaches the engine. Every change here is
additive: a definition written for 2.1.x means the same thing to 2.2.0, with the one exception
called out under *Changed*.

### Added
- **The worker app is now a test instrument: it plays back whatever scenario you ask for.** Testing
  a workflow meant answering its tasks, and answering its tasks meant writing a worker — one per
  scenario, or one with a branch per scenario, until the scaffolding outnumbered the workflow under
  test. The worker app now does no work at all. A process states what its tasks should do in a
  `TEST_CONFIG` variable, and the worker plays it:

  ```json
  {
    "default": { "durationMs": 200, "outcome": "COMPLETED" },
    "tasks": {
      "reserve-seat": { "durationMs": 500, "variables": [{ "name": "seatId", "value": "12A" }] },
      "charge-card":  { "outcome": "ERROR", "reason": "card declined" },
      "notify":       { "outcome": "NO_REPLY" }
    }
  }
  ```

  The keys are step ids — the engine sends an empty task id for every `ACTION` step, filling that
  field only for `USER_TASK` and `RULE`. A task can state its duration, its outcome, the reason it
  failed, the log lines it emits and when, the variables it hands back, how many of the first
  attempts to fail before succeeding, how many times to send its reply, and whether to ignore a
  cancellation. Three of those exist for states no
  ordinary worker can be asked to produce on demand: `NO_REPLY` is a worker that took the task and
  hung, which is what the step timeout is written for; a duplicate reply and a reply after
  cancellation are workers misbehaving, and what the engine does with them is a property of the
  engine worth being able to point at.

  Unknown properties and malformed JSON fail the task with the parse error as its reason, on the
  process you started. A misspelled `durationMS` quietly meaning "two seconds" would turn a test
  that proves nothing into a test that looks like it passed.

  It also records every task it is given, and offers a UI at `/_worker` for browsing them and
  canning a different reply for next time — for the processes you cannot edit. `TEST_CONFIG` always
  wins over a stored override: a suite whose result depends on a table someone edited by hand last
  Tuesday is not a suite. Every recorded row says which of the two answered it, because that is the
  first question anyone asks when a run surprises them.

  New module `modules/test-worker`, deliberately outside the `io.mateu.workflow` package tree so
  that everything which scans the engine's packages does not sweep up a worker binding and two JPA
  stores from any classpath that happens to contain it. `modules/sample-worker` is untouched and
  stays what it was — the hundred-line worker people copy.

  `DIST-13` (`Dist13TestWorkerScenariosTest`) drives the whole thing against a real orchestrator
  over real PostgreSQL and Kafka: a saga completed, a saga rolled back, a flaky step retried, a
  silent step timed out, and two processes disagreeing about the same task at once. It earned its
  place twice on the first run — the worker had assumed a retry arrives as a new task execution
  (the engine re-dispatches the same one, so the count never left 1 and a flaky step failed
  forever), and had led with task ids in a protocol that sends them empty.

- **Definitions can be imported from a directory on disk, not only from Git.**
  `workflow.directory-import.directories` and `forms.directory-import.directories` (or
  `WORKFLOW_DEFINITIONS_DIRS` / `FORMS_DEFINITIONS_DIRS` in the standalone apps) name directories
  scanned at startup:

  ```yaml
  workflow:
    directory-import:
      directories:
        - /definitions/workflows
  ```

  Git import reads what is **committed**, which is what a deployment wants and exactly what the
  loop where someone is *writing* a definition does not: edit, commit, restart, discover the commit
  was the step you forgot. A mounted volume of definitions had no other way in — forms have no
  classpath loading at all, and the workflow one needs the files inside the jar.

  Pruning, provenance and the per-file error handling are the same as for a repository, because it
  is the same code: importing a directory is what the git import already did once the clone
  finished, and it now lives in `ImportWorkflowDefinitionsFromDirectoryUseCase` /
  `ImportFormsFromDirectoryUseCase`, which the git import calls. A directory that is not there is
  reported as an error rather than passed over — a typo in a mount path should not look like an
  empty definition list.

- **A form field can declare its choices, as value/label pairs.** A field that picks from a fixed
  list — `radio`, `select`, `combobox`, `listBox`, `choice` — had no way to say what the list is,
  so a definition either left the picker empty or spelled the choices out in the field's
  description and hoped:

  ```yaml
  - id: decision
    label: Decision
    dataType: string
    stereotype: radio
    options:
      - value: WALK
        label: Walk the guest to another hotel
      - value: REFUND
        label: Refund the reservation
      - value: REJECT          # no label → the user sees "REJECT"
  ```

  The value is what the form submits and what the process variable ends up holding; the label is
  what the user reads. Keeping them apart is the point: the workflow's guards stay written against
  stable codes (`decision == 'REFUND'`) while the wording changes freely. The visual form editor
  edits the pairs and previews the real choices, and `form-definitions.md` documents the field
  format — which until now described a `type: SELECT` / `options: ["A","B"]` shape the schema has
  never accepted.

- **…or fetch them from a REST endpoint, with `optionsSource`.** A list written into a definition
  says what the choices were when it was authored; when they are a catalogue or a directory, what
  you want is what they are now:

  ```yaml
  - id: country
    label: Country
    dataType: string
    stereotype: select
    optionsSource:
      url: https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all?fields=cca2,name
      valuePath: cca2
      labelPath: name.common
  ```

  The engine only carries the descriptor — it never calls the endpoint. The fetch is the renderer's,
  through mateu's `RestDataSource` / `@RestOptions`: a form talking to any REST API without the
  backend in the middle. `url`, `headers` and `body` interpolate `${state.x}`, so one field's
  choices can depend on another's answer and refetch when it changes. A field declares `options` or
  `optionsSource`, never both, and the schema rejects one that declares both.

  `proxy: true` moves the fetch from the browser to the server — no CORS, and a `${secret.X}`
  placeholder resolved server-side instead of shipped to the client. Mateu never takes a proxied
  endpoint from the request (it would be an open relay), so the task pages declare what they carry
  through mateu's `RestSourceSupplier` (3.0-alpha.291): what the server fetches is only ever what
  the stored definition declares. Without it, the fetch is the browser's and the endpoint must be
  reachable from there.

- **`onFalse` on a precondition link: `WAIT` (the default) or `DISCARD`.** What a false condition
  means used to be decided by where it was written — a guard on a link held the step and kept the
  process open around it, a step-level `preconditionExpression` discarded the step and let the
  process finish. Those are two different statements, and both are worth making about one route
  in, so the link says which:

  ```json
  "preconditions": [
    { "stepId": "validate", "expression": "ratePlan == 'NON_REFUNDABLE'", "onFalse": "DISCARD" }
  ]
  ```

  This is what an optional or exclusive branch wants and what a link could not say before: the
  step is skipped when the condition does not hold, without the condition also having to apply to
  every other route into the step. `WAIT` is the default, so every existing link keeps its
  behaviour, and the property is written back out only when it is `DISCARD`.

### Fixed
- **Annotation processing was on by accident, and pruning a dependency turned it off.** Since JDK 23
  javac no longer runs processors found on the classpath, and maven-compiler-plugin follows it, so
  whether a module got Lombok and Mateu's UI registrations was decided by whether some dependency
  happened to pull a processor in. `sample-worker` is where it surfaced — dropping the Mateu UI
  dependencies it never used cost its `@Slf4j` classes their `log` field, reported as a missing
  symbol rather than as "nothing was processed" — but every module was one dependency change away
  from the same silence. The parent pom now says `<proc>full</proc>`.
- **The worker image could never have been built from its Dockerfile.** Two independent reasons:
  the builder stage ran `mvn dependency:go-offline` against a pom depending on
  `io.mateu.workflow:*:1.0-SNAPSHOT`, which is published nowhere, so it failed on the first line it
  ran; and the `COPY` named `app-*.jar` while the artifact is `worker-standalone-app-*.jar`, left
  over from the template the file was copied from. Neither had ever run — the image on Docker Hub
  was pushed by hand from a laptop. It is now runtime-only, from a jar the reactor built, which is
  the same shape as the `demo/*/Dockerfile.runtime` files the images that do get built come from.
- **The worker's healthcheck probed an endpoint the app did not serve.** `HEALTHCHECK` called
  `/actuator/health` with no actuator on the classpath, on a hardcoded `8080` rather than
  `${SERVER_PORT}`, and the entrypoint activated a `prod` profile that has never existed.
- **The worker's context test tested a different application.** It declared an H2 datasource and
  `workflow.persistence=jpa` — a property that app does not read — while the app itself ran with no
  database at all, so the context it proved could start was not the application's. It now starts the
  real configuration, and asserts the binding, the stores and the pages are actually there.
- **`failuresBeforeSuccess` could never let a step through, and DIST-13 is how that was found.** The
  worker counted a step's attempts by counting its rows within the process, on the assumption that
  the engine retries by issuing a new task execution. It does not: it re-dispatches the *same*
  `taskExecutionId` and keeps the count itself. So the retry overwrote the very row being counted,
  every attempt looked like the first, and a step told to fail twice failed until the engine ran out
  of retries. It now counts deliveries of the task execution, which is what the engine's model
  actually offers.
- **`sample-worker` pulled 70 MB of native library into every image built from it.** It depended on
  `spring-cloud-stream-binder-kafka-streams`, which brings `rocksdbjni`, and on Mateu's UI — none of
  it imported by any class in the module, and nothing anywhere in the repository uses Kafka Streams.
  The worker app's jar went from 176 MB to 54 MB.

- **Forms saved as `.ecform` were never imported from git.** Both IDE plugins register `.ecform` as
  the form file type — it is what the visual editor writes and what the schema follows the user
  into — but the git scan looked only at `.json`, `.yaml` and `.yml`, so those forms were skipped
  in silence. Its workflow twin has always accepted `.ec`. Parsed as YAML, which reads JSON too.
- **The Maven plugin rejected every definition whose preconditions are declared as links.** Its
  structural checks read only `preconditionStepIds`/`preconditionStepId`, so a step declaring
  `preconditions` looked like it waited for nothing and the entry-point rule reported it as a step
  nothing would ever start — failing the build on a valid workflow. The same blindness quietly
  narrowed the dangling-reference, self-reference and cycle checks, which never saw those edges.
  It now resolves all three spellings in the engine's own order.
- **The conditions on `preconditions` links are JEXL-checked at build time**, as
  `preconditionExpression` and `correlationExpression` already were. They are the preferred place
  to write a condition, and an unparseable one there fails closed at runtime just as silently.

### Changed
- **A step-level `preconditionExpression` is folded into the step's incoming links.** A condition
  is about a route into a step; a step-level one is the special case where every route asks the
  same thing. `Step.resolvedPreconditions()` now ANDs it onto each link, so a guard has one home
  and the engine has one place that evaluates it — `shouldRunStep` no longer asks two questions.

  Behaviour is preserved, including the part that was never about *where* the condition was
  written: a false step-level expression **skips** the step (the branch was not taken, and the
  process may finish around it), while a false condition on a link **holds** it. That axis is now
  explicit as `GuardMode` on the folded link — `WAIT`, what a link condition has always done, or
  `DISCARD`, what a step-level one has always done — instead of being decided by the spelling.

  One consequence is a fix, and it can change which branch a flow takes: a `CHOICE` picks its
  successor by the condition **on the link**, and was blind to one written at step level. Such a
  successor looked unguarded — i.e. like the else branch — so a `CHOICE` could take the default,
  or lose a tie-break, in a case its author had guarded. It now reads that condition, picks the
  branch that matches, and no longer reports the successor as the default in the "CHOICE has no
  default branch" warning. Definitions whose `CHOICE` successors are guarded at step level should
  be re-checked: they now branch as written.

## [2.1.1] - 2026-08-18

### Fixed
- **The `projector-standalone-app` image shipped a vulnerable PostgreSQL driver.** 2.1.0's image
  bundled `org.postgresql:postgresql` 42.7.11 (CVE-2026-54291, HIGH — SCRAM-SHA-256-PLUS downgrade
  defeating man-in-the-middle protection) instead of the 42.7.12 every other artifact here uses.

  The app parents off `spring-boot-starter-parent` rather than the EventConductor root, so the root's
  security overrides never reached it and the Boot BOM's own version won. Every other app repeats
  those overrides for exactly this reason; the new one did not, and the release pipeline scans images
  *after* pushing them, so 2.1.0's projector image reached Docker Hub before the gate caught it.

  **If you pulled `projector-standalone-app:2.1.0` or `:latest` before this release, re-pull.** No
  other image and no Maven Central artifact is affected: the driver is bundled only in that
  application's fat jar, and the application itself is not published to Central.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-08-18

Finishes the read side of sharding. Sharding shipped in 2.0.0 with the write side proven on a
cluster and the query side openly unfinished: each shard ran its own in-process projector, so the
fleet had as many partial answers to "what is running" as it had shards, and none for the whole.

It also closes a **correctness** gap that a fleet-wide read model does not close, and cannot — see
the placement claim below. Everything here is opt-in and additive: a single-cluster deployment, and
a sharded one that does not turn any of it on, behave exactly as they did.

### Added
- **A standalone projector (`projector-standalone-app`) and `workflow.projection.mode=remote`.** In
  remote mode the outbox relay diverts `ProcessStatusChanged` to a shared `process-index` topic
  instead of the shard's own `outbox`, the in-process projector is not created, and the engine reads
  the index from a read database. `listInFlightProcesses`, `countProcessesByStatus`,
  `findByBusinessKey` and the command router's `processId → shardId` lookup answer for the fleet for
  the first time.

  The channel is shared rather than per-shard for the same reason `messages` is: **no shard count
  appears in it**, so adding or draining a shard changes nothing about projection. The projector
  does not depend on the engine — `ProcessStatusChanged` carries the whole projected shape precisely
  so a projector needs no entities, no write schema and no engine beans.

  Diverted, not duplicated. A second copy of the index in the shard's own database would be a
  partial index that looks like a complete one.

- **A synchronous placement claim (`workflow.sharding.placement.datasource.*`).** A business key must
  be placed on exactly one shard, and every redelivery of that creation must come back to it, or the
  per-shard creation guard cannot collapse the duplicate and the fleet runs two processes for one key
  — two sets of side effects, on two shards, that nobody is watching for. The ingress router used to
  answer that from the process-index, which is eventually consistent: a creation redelivered before
  the projection catches up finds nothing and is placed again, somewhere else.

  Placement is now claimed in one atomic statement whose winner and every loser read back the same
  answer. It **fails closed**: a creation that cannot be claimed fails rather than being routed
  anyway, because a failed creation is retryable at its source and a duplicated process is not
  repairable. A sharded deployment without a placement store still works and warns at startup, in
  the terms of the damage rather than of the setting.

  It does not reintroduce the bottleneck sharding removed: sharding exists because one database
  cannot absorb the per-*step* write stream, and a claim is one small insert per *process*.

- **A cutover backfill.** The projector image doubles as a Job (`--backfill.shards=0,1`) that seeds
  the read database from each shard's write tables — the index, so the fleet view is complete from
  the first query, and the placements, so the claim knows where existing business keys already live.
  Idempotent and safe on a live fleet. This is the only step in the design that needs the shard list.

- **`process-index`, a module of its own**, so the projector can depend on the read model without
  depending on the engine. Its JDBC store upserts atomically on PostgreSQL
  (`INSERT … ON CONFLICT … WHERE`): one round-trip instead of two, and the staleness guard stops
  depending on the caller being serialised per process.

- **Fleet checks in the benchmark** (`bench.fleet.jdbc.url`): the index is complete per shard (R8a),
  agrees with the shards on status (R8b — where an ordering bug shows up and nowhere else), and no
  business key is running on two shards (R8c). Added to the per-shard verdict rather than replacing
  it: a read model verified by reading the read model proves nothing, so the two sides are reached by
  different paths.

- **k8s manifests for the fleet half** — the shared database, the compacted `process-index` topic,
  the projector and the backfill Job, plus `deploy-shard.sh fleet` and `backfill`.

### Notes
- **The projection topic must be compacted.** Compaction is what makes the read database rebuildable:
  it keeps the last event per process forever at bounded size, so a projector replaying from the
  earliest offset reconstructs the whole index. Under the default time retention the same replay
  silently loses every process older than the window — a rebuild that appears to succeed. The shipped
  manifest sets `cleanup.policy=compact` before anything produces to the topic.
- **The index is derived and disposable; the placement table is not.** They share a database for
  operational convenience and have completely different durability requirements. Back it up for the
  placements. And do not prune placements casually: a row must outlive the window in which a
  duplicate creation can still arrive, or housekeeping reintroduces the very duplicate the table
  exists to prevent.
- **Not yet cluster-validated.** The write-side sharding in 2.0.0 was proven on a live two-shard run;
  this read side is proven by tests only. Getting sharding onto a cluster surfaced five deployment
  bugs, all configuration, and there is no reason to think this half is different.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-08-17

The first MAJOR since 1.0, for one reason: a field that did nothing now does what it always said it
did, and a definition that names a `topic` other than `downstream` will be dispatched somewhere
else than before. See **Migration** below — it is short, and it only concerns definitions that set
the field.

The **definition format is unchanged and stays at schema version 1**
(`urn:eventconductor:workflow-definition-schema:1`). Every document that validated against 1.3.0
still validates: `topic` went from required to optional, which only relaxes. The MAJOR is about
behaviour, not format, and nothing needs rewriting to be *accepted* — only steps that named a topic
need looking at to keep going where they were going.

### Added
- **`topic` routes a step to a worker pool of its own.** The field has been in the definition
  schema since the beginning, described as "the Kafka topic to dispatch the task to" — and nothing
  read it. `Step.topic()` had no callers anywhere in the engine, and `KafkaDownstreamEventPublisher`
  sent every task to a hard-coded `"downstream"`, so a step naming `order-validator` went exactly
  where a step naming nothing went. It now goes to `order-validator`.

  A topic with no binding of its own is a dynamic destination, created by Spring Cloud Stream on
  first use, so naming one costs the application no configuration. A step that names none keeps
  going to `downstream`, which is the default and the overwhelmingly common case.

  **The step's cancellation follows its task.** `TaskCancellationRequested` — sent when a process is
  cancelled, when a step is stepped over, and when a task times out — goes to the topic that task
  was dispatched to, not to the default. Sent to the default while the task ran on a pool of its
  own it would reach nobody, and the step would run to its `timeout` instead of stopping: a failure
  with no error in it, which is why `KafkaDownstreamEventPublisherTest` asserts the address rather
  than only the payload. The destination is read from the step frozen on the `StepExecution`, not
  from the current definition, so a task already at a worker is cancelled where it actually went
  even if the definition has been re-imported since.

  `DownstreamEventPublisher.publish` takes the destination as a parameter rather than defaulting it,
  so a new call site has to say where its event goes. Embedded mode ignores it: there is one
  in-process `EmbeddedTaskExecutor` and no transport to route over, so it takes every task whatever
  the step says — routing to several in-process pools would be a different feature from naming a
  destination, and `java-api` no longer claims the bean name is matched against the topic, which it
  never was.

  **No migration.** The field already survives the database: steps are stored as JSON
  (`workflow_definition_entity.steps_json`, `step_execution_entity.step_json`), and both already
  carried `topic`. The `step_entity` table, which has no `topic` column, turned out to have no
  writers at all — `StepEntityRepository` has no callers — so it played no part in this.

- **A worker in kafka mode can finally say *why* a task failed.** `1.0-beta.022` fixed "a failing
  step recorded that it failed, and nothing about why" — but only on one side. In embedded mode the
  engine catches the worker's exception on its behalf and fills the `log` field of
  `UpdateStepExecutionCommand`, so the reason lands on the process. In kafka mode the worker answers
  with a `TaskStatusChanged`, which carries a status and variables and **no message**: there was
  nowhere to put the reason. So every kafka-mode failure reached the process log as "Task status
  changed to ERROR" and the explanation existed only in the worker's own stdout, if it logged at
  all. Whoever opened a rolled-back saga saw that it rolled back and nothing about what went wrong.

  `WorkerReply.failed(streamBridge, task, variables, reason)` publishes the reason as a
  `TaskLogEmitted` alongside the failure, so a failure reads the same in both modes. The reason goes
  **first**, and that ordering is the point: both sends are on the existing retry-or-throw path, so a
  broker that will not take the log line throws before anything has been reported at all and the
  task is simply redelivered. Reporting a failure and then losing its explanation would leave the
  engine acting on something nobody can account for, which is the state this exists to end. A null
  or blank reason sends nothing extra and behaves exactly like the three-argument overload, which
  stays — this is purely additive.

  The event was already accepted from `upstream` and recorded by `TaskLogEmittedEventHandler`; what
  was missing was any way to reach it from the API workers actually use. `WorkerReply.send(…,
  TaskLogEmitted)` is now public too, for a worker that wants to log progress rather than a failure.

### Changed
- **`topic` is no longer required on an `ACTION`.** It was required by the schema while nothing read
  it, which made it a field every author had to write on every ACTION step for no effect. The
  requirement did not even hold where it mattered: `WorkflowDefinitionValidator` validates the
  **serialised** definition, and Jackson writes `"topic": null`, which satisfies a JSON Schema
  `required`. A definition omitting it imported cleanly and only the IDE plugins complained — the
  rule nagged the author and protected nothing. It is now optional with a documented default of
  `downstream`, in the engine schema and in the copies the VSCode and IntelliJ plugins bundle.

- **The worker guide no longer teaches the bug.** Its example caught `Exception e` and called the
  three-argument `failed(...)`, discarding `e` without so much as logging it locally — the exact
  shape that makes a failed step unexplainable, copied from the documentation into real workers. It
  now logs and passes the reason.

### Migration
- **A step that names a `topic` other than `downstream` now goes there.** Until this release its
  value was ignored and its task arrived on `downstream` regardless, so a definition carrying a
  decorative topic — written against the documentation, or copied from the example in the AI
  reference, which gave two steps two different topics — has been working only because the field
  did nothing. Such a step will now be dispatched to a destination nobody consumes, and a task sent
  where no worker listens fails silently: nothing refuses it, and the step sits until its `timeout`.
  Before upgrading, either point each `topic` at a destination a worker really consumes, or remove
  it so the step goes to `downstream` as it has been doing. Steps with no `topic` are unaffected.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-08-14

### Added
- **`onTimeoutStepId` — route a step's timeout forward instead of failing.** By default a step that
  times out (after any retries) is a failure: it ends `TIMEOUT` and the process errors. A step may
  now name an `onTimeoutStepId` — its own on-timeout branch — and the flow routes there instead; the
  timed-out step ends `TIMEOUT` but is **not** counted as a process failure. It is the forward-routing
  dual of compensation: compensation rolls *backward* over steps that already **succeeded**, while
  on-timeout routes *forward* because a step that timed out never succeeded (there is nothing of its
  own to compensate). This is the native way to say "if nobody actions this human task in 30s, cancel
  the booking" — previously only expressible by racing the step against a parallel `TIMER`/`FORK`. In
  the graph editor an on-timeout line is drawn with **shift+alt+drag** (from a task step), rendered
  amber with a ⏱ clock chip showing the timeout, and the token-flow animation follows it. See
  [On-timeout routing](https://eventconductor.io/guides/retries-timeouts-compensation/#on-timeout-routing).

### Changed
- **A `USER_TASK` (and `RULE`) can now declare a compensation.** The editor's compensation gesture was
  restricted to `ACTION`/`PROCESS`/`WAIT_FOR_MESSAGE`/`DYNAMIC`; it now covers every **task step** —
  `ACTION`, `USER_TASK`, `RULE`, `WAIT_FOR_MESSAGE`, `PROCESS`, `DYNAMIC` — since a completed human task
  or rule has an effect worth undoing. The same set is what may carry an `onTimeoutStepId`.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-08-13

### Added
- **`CHOICE` — an exclusive-split gateway.** Where a `FORK` takes every eligible branch, a `CHOICE`
  takes exactly one: the first successor whose per-link guard holds, evaluating them from the longest
  guard expression to the shortest (most specific first), with an unguarded successor as the default
  (`else`), tried last. The pick **latches** — once a branch has started, a later change to the
  variables a guard reads cannot hand the split to another — and a `CHOICE` whose guards are all false
  with no default takes no branch and lets the process complete (a build-time warning flags the
  missing default). It is the split counterpart of the `XOR` join, which is how its branches should
  reconverge, and renders as the amber "×" gateway. See the
  [step types reference](https://eventconductor.io/reference/step-types/#choice).

### Changed
- **The graph editor is now a proper diagramming surface.** A left palette carries one item per step
  type, each drawn as the node it drops. Drag a palette item onto the canvas to create a node, or onto
  an existing node to create it connected as a successor. A step's **type is fixed at creation** (edit
  the YAML to change it). Preconditions and compensation are wired on the graph rather than in a form:
  **shift+drag** draws a precondition line, **alt+drag** draws a compensation line (only from a
  compensable step — `ACTION`/`PROCESS`/`WAIT_FOR_MESSAGE`/`DYNAMIC`), and selecting a connection edits
  that link's precondition — and a `?` **Help** button in the toolbar lists these gestures so they are
  discoverable. Connections are drawn as arrows. The token-flow animation opens paused; a retrying step
  pulses red once per failed attempt before it succeeds, and a slow step (a human task, a wait, an
  AND-join) lingers with a single ping instead of repeating. The same editor ships in the VSCode and
  IntelliJ plugins.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-08-10

### Added
- **Dynamic workflows: a step that grows the running process.** A new `DYNAMIC` step type is
  dispatched to a worker like an `ACTION`, but its reply may return a batch of new steps to add to
  the process it is running in — so a flow can decide its own shape at runtime (a fan-out whose
  width is only known once the work starts, a plan a worker computes and then executes). The worker
  sends them with [`WorkerReply.inject(...)`](https://eventconductor.io/reference/java-api/) (or
  `injectAndComplete(...)`); the message is `StepsInjected`. Injection is **add-only** — it never
  rewrites or removes existing steps — and the worker supplies each step *with its own
  preconditions*, because there is no default wiring: an injected step with no precondition is
  simply unreachable, a visible bug in the graph rather than something the engine papers over. The
  batch is validated engine-side as a whole (unique ids that do not collide with the process's
  steps, every precondition reference resolved, no cycle introduced) and, if anything fails, the
  **whole batch is rejected and the `DYNAMIC` step is failed** with the reason — so a bad injection
  is a failed step, not a silently dropped one. Only a `DYNAMIC` step may inject. Recursion is
  allowed (an injected step may itself be `DYNAMIC`) but bounded by two step-budget guards: the
  engine-wide `workflow.dynamic.max-steps-per-process` (default `500`) and a per-definition
  `maxSteps` override. Injected steps are marked in the process diagram — a dashed accent border and
  a ⚡ corner badge — and carry their provenance (`injectedByStepExecutionId`, the `DYNAMIC` step
  execution that added them), which also makes a re-delivered injection exactly idempotent. See the
  [Dynamic Workflows guide](https://eventconductor.io/guides/dynamic-workflows/).

## [1.0.1] - 2026-08-10

### Added
- **Failed steps are badged in the process diagram.** A completed step carries a green check in its
  bottom-right corner; a failed (`ERROR`) step used to be marked only by its red border. It now gets
  a matching badge — a white cross in a red circle — so a failure reads as clearly as a success at a
  glance. Cancelled steps stay unbadged, and a compensation keeps its undo arrow.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-08-09

First stable release. The formats, configuration and metrics documented here are the frozen 1.0
public API.

### Changed
- **The step property `rollbackable` is now `compensable`.** The engine calls it compensation, so
  the field that turns it on now matches. Definitions and in-flight state written with `rollbackable`
  keep working unchanged — the field is read through a `@JsonAlias`, so old JSON still deserialises,
  and a migration renames the definition table's column — but new definitions should use
  `compensable`, and the JSON schema, examples and docs now use it throughout.

### Fixed
- **Compensation no longer runs for the step that failed.** A saga rolls back by undoing the work
  that *committed*, in reverse — so it compensates the steps that completed successfully before the
  failure, and not the one that failed, which by definition committed nothing to undo. The engine
  used to compensate the failed step as well (treating "it attempted its work" as enough), which
  could reverse work that never happened. Now only `COMPLETED` steps are compensated; a step that
  ends in `ERROR` or `TIMEOUT` triggers the rollback but is not part of it and keeps its terminal
  status as the record of why the process rolled back.

- **A step's timeout no longer counts the time it spent queued.** The clock started when the
  orchestrator marked the step started and wrote its dispatch to the outbox, so everything before a
  worker saw it — outbox residence, the relay, the broker — was charged against the step's own
  execution budget. Under load that turns a backlog into failures rather than latency: once the
  dispatch backlog outgrows the timeout, steps expire before anyone could have run them, their
  retries expire with them, and their sagas roll back. A deliberate 120/s saturation run produced
  12,517 `ERROR` and 3,035 `COMPENSATION_FAILED` that way — business state left half-undone, none of
  it a worker doing anything wrong, while the outbox itself had lost nothing and drained cleanly
  afterwards at ~240/s.

  The clock now starts when the dispatch has actually been relayed out. Two published contracts
  already described it this way and neither was true: `timeout` is "Maximum execution time" in the
  definition schema, and `eventconductor.step.duration` is "from dispatch to final status" in the
  observability reference. Both derive from the same field, so one fix makes both so — and step
  duration now measures execution rather than execution plus queueing.

  A queue is capacity, not failure: a step waiting for a worker now simply waits, and shows up in
  `eventconductor.steps.stalled` if it waits too long, which is the signal built for it.

### Added
- **Tests for the paths whose failure mode is silence.** The outbox drain (`OutboxDrain`), where
  delivering before marking Sent is what makes the at-least-once guarantee, and a refused delivery
  must leave its row Pending — the shape of the defect that lost 71 of 642,912 messages during a
  broker outage. The boot-time rearm (`InFlightStepRearmRunner`), where a missed step is not
  un-timed-out but invisible: never scanned again, its process stopped for ever with nothing logged.
  And the tracing bridge, whose entire contract is that tracing failures never reach the work.
- **The 1.0 public surfaces are pinned as literals.** Meter names and tags for all four metric
  adapters, and the MCP tool names for the workflow, forms and rules engines. Both are listed as
  stable in `versioning.md` and both have consumers outside this repository — a Grafana dashboard,
  an alert rule, someone's assistant configuration — so a rename broke them and broke nothing here.
  Asserting the constants would not have caught it; the tests assert the published strings.
- **The filesystem half of Git import**, including the guard that stops a configured
  `directory: ../..` from walking out of the throwaway clone, and the rule that one unparseable
  definition costs that file rather than aborting the import of every file after it.

### Changed
- **The coverage gate now measures the code that carries the risk.** It asked for 85% of lines and
  passed, over a bundle that excluded the outbox, the schedulers, the JPA repositories, the message
  REST API, the MCP tools, the autoconfiguration and the Git import. Two exclusions remain —
  generated gRPC stubs and the Vaadin view classes — and the gate is now a per-module floor set just
  under what each module measures, so no module can regress. Over the honest scope the repository is
  at 65.7% per module and 76.4% aggregated; `TESTING.md` records both and how to reproduce them.
- `InFlightStepRearmRunner.rearmOnce` and two Git-import helpers widened from private to
  package-private so a single pass can be driven without the retry thread or a repository to clone.

### Fixed
- **The engine's own migrations never ran in any of the three standalone applications.** The
  initializer that applies them was guarded by `@ConditionalOnSingleCandidate(DataSource.class)`,
  which asks whether the data source's *bean definition* is visible at the moment the condition
  runs — and in a real boot of these apps it is not. The condition reported "did not find any beans"
  while Hikari's own autoconfiguration matched in the same report, so the bean was never registered
  and not one migration was applied. Nothing failed, because `ddl-auto` defaults to `update` and
  Hibernate built the schema instead — without a single index, which is the exact slow failure
  1.0-beta.025 exists to prevent. Under the chart's `DDL_AUTO=validate` the apps did not start at
  all. The data source is now resolved when the bean is *created* rather than when it is *defined*,
  which takes autoconfiguration ordering out of the picture; an ambiguous set of data sources now
  says so instead of silently skipping. The autoconfiguration's own test could never have caught
  this — an `ApplicationContextRunner` orders the autoconfigurations by construction — so each app
  now has a `@SpringBootTest` that boots it the way it really boots.
- **`forms-standalone-app` kept every form definition and task execution on the heap.** It set
  `workflow.persistence`, which the forms engine does not read, and never set `forms.persistence` —
  so an application wired to PostgreSQL, shipping forms migrations and running under
  `DDL_AUTO=validate` lost all of it on restart. It also meant the task list was permanently empty:
  `Tasks`, `TasksV2`, `TasksWidget` and `CancelTaskUseCase` read the JPA repository directly, so
  they queried a table nothing was writing to. Now `forms.persistence: ${FORMS_PERSISTENCE:jpa}`,
  as `rules.persistence` already was.
- **A form silently lost a field to any other form that reused its id.** `field_entity` was keyed on
  the field id alone, but a field id is unique only *within* its form — `form-schema.json` says so,
  and git-imported definitions use human slugs (`approved`, `comment`) that repeat freely. Saving
  the second form re-parented the row and the first form's field was gone. The key is now
  `(form_id, id)`. Three more that had never run in production alongside it: a field dropped from a
  definition survived the save that dropped it, deleting a form orphaned its fields (which
  git-import's prune path hits), and field order was whatever the database returned — now stored,
  because a form renders its fields in order. A field that omits the optional `stereotype` no longer
  throws on save; it defaults to `regular`, as the schema documents.

## [1.0-beta.025] - 2026-08-06

The schema travels with the engine.

A workflow engine you can embed has to bring its own tables, and this one did not: the migrations
shipped with the standalone applications, so embedding it meant running on whatever `ddl-auto`
built — which has no indexes at all. It was invisible, because nothing fails; it just gets slow.
The engine now carries its schema in its own jar and applies it itself, into a history table of its
own, and says so out loud when it cannot.

### Fixed
- **The engine now ships and applies its own schema.** The Flyway migrations lived in
  `apps/*-standalone-app`, not in the engine modules, so they existed only for the deployment shape
  we happen to ship. Anyone **embedding** the engine got no migrations at all: `ddl-auto=update`
  built tables and primary keys and no indexes — Hibernate's update path emits no index DDL — so
  every deadline scan, outbox claim and message correlation ran as a sequential scan, silently. The
  documented advice for embedders (`spring.flyway.enabled=true`) could not have worked either: the
  SQL was not on their classpath. The migrations now travel in `workflow-engine`, `forms-engine` and
  `rule-engine`, and each engine runs its own at startup, embedded exactly as in the standalone apps.
- **The engine's migration history is kept away from the host application's.** A host's migrations
  are numbered from V1 and so are the engine's; one shared `flyway_schema_history` collides the two
  numbering spaces and the second to run fails validation on a checksum mismatch. Each engine
  records its history in a table of its own (`eventconductor_schema_history`, `…_forms`, `…_rules`)
  and never touches `flyway_schema_history`. `spring.flyway.*` keeps meaning what it meant: the
  application's own migrations.

### Added
- `workflow.schema.enabled` / `workflow.schema.table` (and the `forms.schema.*` / `rules.schema.*`
  equivalents) — whether an engine applies its own migrations, and where it records them.
- **A startup warning when the engine runs on a schema it is not managing.** Reached by running
  `workflow.persistence=jpa` without `flyway-core` on the classpath, or with
  `workflow.schema.enabled=false`. Both are legitimate; running indexless without knowing it is not.
- Tests for the case that was never covered: an application with a data source and no
  `spring.flyway.*` configuration of its own. They immediately caught an ordering defect — the
  schema autoconfiguration evaluated its condition before the data source existed, so an embedder
  would still have got nothing.

### Changed
- The standalone apps no longer carry the migrations or configure Boot's Flyway for them. They keep
  their historical history-table names through `FLYWAY_TABLE`, so **an existing deployment upgrades
  in place with no manual step**. The Helm chart sets `WORKFLOW_SCHEMA_TABLE` / `FORMS_SCHEMA_TABLE`
  / `RULES_SCHEMA_TABLE` in place of `SPRING_FLYWAY_TABLE`; its `*.flywayTable` values are unchanged.
- `flyway-core` is an optional dependency of the engine modules: a run with
  `workflow.persistence=memory` needs no database and should not carry a migration tool. Embedders
  using `jpa` add it (plus the driver module, e.g. `flyway-database-postgresql`).

## [1.0-beta.024] - 2026-08-06

The gate earns its keep.

The Trivy image gate that landed in beta.023 immediately did the job it was added for: it caught
fixable HIGH/CRITICAL CVEs in core dependencies that would otherwise have shipped silently — Spring
Boot and Spring Framework (security bypass, DoS, XSS), Tomcat (HTTP/2, authentication bypass),
Jackson 2.x and 3.x (arbitrary code execution), Spring Data, Spring for Kafka, the PostgreSQL JDBC
driver, and Alpine OS packages. This release remediates all of them to a clean image.

### Security
- **Spring Boot 4.0.4 → 4.0.7**, which bundles the coordinated Spring fixes (Framework 7.0.8,
  Data Commons 4.0.6, Spring for Kafka 4.0.6, Jackson 3.1.4, Tomcat 11.0.22). Applied to the engine
  library modules (via the reactor root) and to the orchestrator/forms/rules apps (which parent off
  `spring-boot-starter-parent`, so each app pom carries the bump).
- Explicit pins for what the Boot BOM does not cover: **Jackson 2.x → 2.21.4** (arrives via
  `json-schema-validator`; Boot 4 manages only Jackson 3.x) and **PostgreSQL JDBC → 42.7.12**.
- **`apk upgrade`** on the container base images (Alpine → 3.23.5) for the OS package fixes.
- The orchestrator image now scans clean under the release Trivy gate (alpine 0, app.jar 0).

## [1.0-beta.023] - 2026-08-05

The last blockers before the promise.

The hardening a workflow engine cannot go to 1.0 without: a rule can no longer reach out of its
sandbox, a fast-failing step can no longer hammer the thing it depended on, and a rollback that
cannot finish can no longer do so in silence. This beta also writes down the 1.0 compatibility
promise before making it — see [Versioning & Compatibility](doc/src/content/docs/reference/versioning.md)
for exactly what will, and will not, be covered from 1.0.0.

### Security
- **Rule expressions now run sandboxed.** The `rule-runtime` JEXL evaluator built its engine
  without `JexlPermissions.RESTRICTED`, unlike the workflow-engine's precondition evaluator. Rule
  `when`/`then` expressions come from untrusted sources (imported from Git, edited in the UI), so an
  attacker who controlled a rule could reach `Runtime.exec`, `System.exit` or reflection — arbitrary
  code execution on the rules service. The evaluator is now restricted to match the engine's.
- **Docker image release now fails on HIGH/CRITICAL CVEs.** The three Trivy image scans in the
  release workflow ran with `exit-code: '0'`, so vulnerabilities were reported but never blocked a
  publish. They now gate the release (`exit-code: '1'`, `ignore-unfixed` retained).
- **`rule-engine` upgraded jgit 6.10.1 → 7.7.0**, matching `workflow-engine`/`forms-engine`.
  rule-engine also clones remote repositories, so it carried the same fetch/parse CVEs the other
  modules had already been bumped away from.
- **Standalone apps fail closed on the DB password.** The orchestrator/forms/rules configs defaulted
  `password` to `${DB_PASSWORD:user_password}`, so a bare-jar boot with the env var unset came up on
  a known password (contradicting the Dockerfiles, which state there is no default). The default is
  removed; Helm and docker-compose supply `DB_PASSWORD` as before.

### Changed
- **In-memory persistence warns loudly at startup.** `workflow.persistence=memory` (the default)
  keeps all state in the JVM heap and loses every running process on restart. The engine now logs a
  prominent warning so a non-durable store is a deliberate choice, not a silent one.
- **The bundled Grafana engine dashboard charts the engine's own metrics.** It previously showed
  only infrastructure (Kafka lag, executors, Hikari, HTTP). Added process running / outbox pending /
  stalled steps / compensations-failed stat panels (the alert-worthy gauges) and process-outcome and
  step-retry/compensation/dead-letter rate timeseries.

### Fixed
- **Auto-retry now backs off instead of hot-looping.** A failed step with retries left was
  re-dispatched immediately, so a worker that failed fast burned the entire retry budget in
  milliseconds and hammered the failing dependency. Failed steps are now parked in a new
  `AWAITING_RETRY` status for an exponential, jittered backoff (`workflow.retry.backoff-*`) and the
  scheduler re-dispatches them when the delay elapses. Manual retries still reset immediately.
- **A failed compensation is no longer silent.** When a compensation step itself failed after its
  retries, the saga rollback halted and the process was left in `ERROR`, half-rolled-back, with no
  terminal state, metric or alert — indistinguishable from a plain failure. Such a process now
  reaches the distinct, sticky terminal `COMPENSATION_FAILED`, increments the new
  `eventconductor.compensations.failed` counter and logs loudly.

### Added
- `eventconductor.compensations.failed` metric and the `COMPENSATION_FAILED` process status.
- `workflow.retry.backoff-base-ms` / `-multiplier` / `-max-ms` / `-jitter` configuration and the
  `AWAITING_RETRY` step-execution status.
- **A documented versioning & compatibility policy** (`reference/versioning`): what 1.0 keeps stable
  (definition formats, configuration, worker/Kafka contract, embedded entry points, HTTP/MCP surface,
  metric names) and what it explicitly does not (the internal Java model classes — program against
  the definition format, not the `WorkflowDefinition`/`Step` types).
- **Versioned definition-format schemas.** The workflow/rule/form JSON Schemas now carry a versioned
  `$id` (`…-schema:1`), so a future backward-incompatible format change is a distinct version rather
  than a silent break.

### Plugins — IntelliJ 0.1.3, VS Code 0.1.2
- **The editors ship the current graph.** Neither plugin's sources have changed since the last
  plugin release; what has changed is the component they carry, and they only carry a new one when
  they are released. Installed alongside `1.0-beta.022`, the editor was laying a definition out
  differently from the web viewer — it had the bundle from 4 August, before the rollback edges
  reached the layout. These builds bring compensation steps drawn amber once they have run, the
  rollback edges laid out (so a compensation sits to the right of the step it undoes rather than at
  the far left with its line drawn back across the graph), and a paused animation that stays paused
  when a node is selected.

## [1.0-beta.022] - 2026-08-05

A failure that says why.

An exception escaping an embedded worker has failed its step since the last release, and the
process recorded that it had failed and nothing about why — the reason existed only in the
application's stdout. Two separate things were dropping it, and the second one had been hiding
the first for as long as there has been an Errors tab: it was empty however badly a process had
gone, because it looked for a string nothing writes.

### Fixed
- **A failing step recorded that it failed, and nothing about why.** `UpdateStepExecutionCommand`
  has always carried a log line — a worker's message, or the exception the engine catches on its
  behalf in embedded mode — and the use case dropped it: the process log said "Task status changed
  to ERROR" and the reason existed only in the application's stdout. It is written to the process
  now, typed by outcome, so a failure lands where failures are read.
- **And where they are read was reading the wrong thing.** Log messages are stored as
  `MessageType.name()` — "Error" — and all four readers compared against the lowercase literal, so
  the Errors tab of a process was empty however badly it had gone, its errors appeared in the
  Messages tab instead, and the graph's hover card never had a reason to show. Matched
  case-insensitively now, which covers the rows already written.
- **Selecting a node started the animation the operator had paused.** Focusing belongs to the
  simulation — it picks the paths the token will take and lights them while the rest of the graph
  falls back — so on a paused graph a click now selects the node and leaves the picture neutral,
  clearing any focus left over from before the pause. The token itself was already staying
  stopped; it was the lighting that read as it starting again.

## [1.0-beta.021] - 2026-08-05

The mode we were the only ones running.

Kafka mode worked in the standalone application, in the benchmark and in the distributed tests —
everywhere we run the engine ourselves — and could not work anywhere else, because the one
property that makes its consumers function was in each of those configurations and in none of the
documentation. An application that followed the README to the letter got a `ClassCastException` on
the first event of its first process, and its whole outbox dead-lettered behind it. The engine
brings its own bindings now.

The rest is a compensated saga finally looking like what it is: a process that finished.

### Fixed
- **Kafka mode did not work outside our own applications.** The engine's consumers take a batch —
  `Consumer<Message<List<DomainEvent>>>` — because a poll batch is committed as one transaction
  per process. A binding without `consumer.batch-mode` delivers one record and does not convert
  it, so the payload arrives as a `byte[]` and the first event dies with `ClassCastException:
  class [B cannot be cast to class java.util.List`; retries exhaust and every outbox event is
  dead-lettered. That property was set in the standalone application's YAML, in the benchmark and
  in the distributed tests, and appeared in no documentation at all — every snippet in the README,
  the configuration reference, the AI references and the scaffold skill wired the destinations and
  left it out. Those same snippets gave both consumers one shared group, which is the
  range-assignor trap fixed for our own configuration in `1.0-beta.015` and never fixed in the
  docs. The engine contributes its own bindings now — destinations, a group per binding,
  batch-mode — as the lowest-precedence property source, so anything an application declares still
  wins. It does not contribute `spring.cloud.function.definition`: that lists the functions the
  application composes, and a default would silently drop a worker's or the forms engine's. Also
  `spring.cloud.stream.function.definition`, in the README and the scaffold skill: that property
  has not been read since Boot 2.x.
- **A rolled-back process looked like one that had stopped halfway.** Reaching `COMPENSATED` only
  set the status: the steps the flow never reached stayed `CREATED` — indefinitely, on a process
  that is over — and the completion bar stayed frozen wherever the failure happened. A finished
  saga went on showing steps that looked like they were waiting their turn, at 43%. The steps that
  can no longer run are cancelled now, the same ones an END transition cancels, and the process is
  100% complete: the rollback ran to the end. The step that failed keeps its `ERROR`.
- **`COMPENSATED` is drawn green**, like `COMPLETED`. It was amber, which said "something here
  needs looking at" about a process that had already cleaned up after itself, and sat it next to
  the `ERROR` processes that do.
- **The rollback edges were drawn but never laid out.** ELK was given the flow and nothing else,
  so a compensation step — which declares no preconditions — was a node with no edges at all: it
  went to the first layer, at the far left, and its rollback line was then drawn from the middle
  of the flow back across everything in front of it, through whatever nodes were in the way. The
  layout gets those edges now, which puts each compensation in the layer after the step it undoes
  — to its right, where the eye looks for it, stacked above or below the flow rather than beyond
  it — and routes around what is already there. Definitions written either way lay out the same.

### Added
- **The demo images are published from CI**, by a `workflow_dispatch` job that builds the demo
  reactor once and pushes all seven, each labelled with the revision it was built at. They used to
  be built by hand with buildx: the ones on Docker Hub had been pushed three hours before the
  Dockerfiles they came from were committed, and nothing recorded which commit any of them
  contained. Their tag is `demo-0.1.0` now — the demo does not ship with the engine, and a tag
  shaped like an engine version reads as stale the moment the engine moves.

### Fixed (build)
- **The demo did not build from a clean checkout.** Five of its services depend on
  `io.mateu.workflow:shared:1.0-SNAPSHOT`, which nothing publishes; on any machine that had built
  the repository it was in `~/.m2`, so it appeared to build on its own.

## [1.0-beta.020] - 2026-08-05

One worker is not the engine — and a step with nothing to wait for is not a step that may run.

Both came out of the same afternoon with a proof-of-concept saga. A hotel service that accepted
the connection and never answered stopped every process in the JVM, not just its own, and the
symptom named nothing: the processes created afterwards sat with every step in `CREATED`, which
the UI describes as "waiting for its preconditions". And the compensation steps of that saga ran
in the happy path, because an anchor written without its guard is an ordinary edge — an anchor
they only needed because "no preconditions" meant "start immediately".

### Fixed
- **An embedded worker that blocked stopped the engine, and one that threw stopped its process.**
  Embedded dispatch calls the worker and waits for it to return, on the calling thread — which
  under `jpa` persistence is `embedded-outbox-relay`, the single thread draining the outbox and so
  the only one advancing every process in the JVM. One HTTP call to a service that accepted the
  connection and never answered froze all of them: no step-over ran, and processes created
  afterwards sat with every step in `CREATED`, which the UI describes as "waiting for its
  preconditions" and which looks nothing like a stuck worker.

  And an exception escaping a worker left its `StepExecution` exactly as it was, `PENDING`,
  waiting for a reply that was never coming; only the outbox row was parked as `Error`. Without a
  `timeout` on the step nothing would ever look at it again. The engine now records the throw as
  the step's failure, so retries and compensation engage. Reporting `ERROR` yourself is still the
  contract — a throw carries no variables and no message of your choosing.

### Changed
- **A step with nothing to wait for no longer runs.** Eligibility asked whether every
  precondition was satisfied, and every precondition of none is satisfied — so "no preconditions"
  meant "start immediately". That is why a compensation step had to be anchored to some step it
  had no relationship with and guarded with `"preconditionExpression": "false"`: a fiction whose
  only job was to keep the dataflow away from it, that had to be written correctly every single
  time, and that turned into a live branch of the happy path when it was not. A compensation is
  declared on the step it undoes and started by the rollback pipeline; it needs no way in of its
  own, and now it may have none.

  Only a flow's entry points run with no preconditions: `START`, and a `WAIT_FOR_MESSAGE` that
  begins a flow rather than sitting inside one. The roots rule becomes a reachability rule —
  a step with no preconditions that is neither of those nor another step's `compensationStepId`
  is rejected at load, because nothing would ever start it. Definitions using the false-guarded
  anchor keep working unchanged, in the engine and in the Maven plugin's build-time validation;
  the anchor was never real flow and is still ignored by the topology warnings.

### Added
- **A step that ran as a compensation is drawn amber in the process diagram**, with an undo badge
  instead of the green tick and a `COMPENSATION` chip on its hover card. A compensation that
  succeeds is `COMPLETED` like any other step, so it was drawn in the same green as the work it
  had just undone: a fully rolled-back saga read as a successful one with a few extra boxes. The
  graph already knew which steps those were — it draws their rollback edges — so nothing new is
  sent to it.
- **`workflow.embedded.worker-threads`** (plus `worker-queue-capacity` and
  `worker-shutdown-grace-ms`): hands embedded tasks to a bounded pool instead of running them on
  the dispatching thread. Off by default, because turning it on changes what delivery means —
  `Sent` becomes handed-off rather than finished, as it already is in `kafka` mode, so a task lost
  to a crash is recovered by the step's `timeout` rather than by redelivery, and two tasks of one
  process can be in flight at once. A full pool rejects, and the rejection is classified retryable
  so the outbox holds the message and offers it again rather than dead-lettering a queue for being
  busy.

## [1.0-beta.019] - 2026-08-05

The first time the whole thing was deployed to a real cluster — the engine and the seven demo
services, on Kubernetes, against one database — and it did not come up. Four separate reasons, none
of which a test or a lint could have found, because each of them only exists once the three
applications are pointed at one database and at one another. Two of them had been shipping in
releases for weeks: the rule engine's gRPC server has not started since `1.0-beta.009`, and the
chart named an image tag that was never published.

Nothing here changes how the engine behaves. It is the difference between software that passes its
tests and software that starts.

### Fixed
- **The orchestrator and the rule engine could not start next to the forms engine.** They share a
  database, each ships its own migrations numbered from V1, and all three wrote to Flyway's default
  history table: whichever started first put its V1 there and the other two refused to start on a
  checksum mismatch. Forms and rules now keep their own history tables, and all three baseline at
  version 0 rather than 1 — `baseline-on-migrate` reads a non-empty schema as "my tables are
  already here", which in a shared database means somebody else got there first, so the app skipped
  the baseline that creates its own tables and then failed on the first migration that touched one.
- **The rule engine's gRPC server never started**, in every release since `1.0-beta.009`: the stubs
  were generated with protoc 4.35.1 while grpc-java and Spring Boot's dependency management resolve
  protobuf-java 4.32.0, and generated code refuses to load on a runtime older than itself. The
  failing bean took the whole application context down with it. protoc is now pinned to the runtime
  the hosts actually get.
- **The database ran out of connections.** PostgreSQL allows 100 by default and the chart's own
  defaults ask for 96 — three apps, two replicas each, sixteen connections apiece — so anything
  else sharing it, including the demo's own services, was refused with "sorry, too many clients
  already". The chart now sets `postgres.maxConnections` (200), and the demo services take small
  pools out of it.
- **The chart deployed images that do not exist**: `appVersion` was the placeholder `0.0.0`, so
  installing straight from the repository left every pod in `ImagePullBackOff`. It names a real
  release, and the comment claiming CI pinned it is gone — nothing did.

### Added
- **A chart for the demo** (`charts/eventconductor-demo/`): the seven services, deployed as
  ordinary applications against an existing EventConductor release. Runtime images for the five
  that lacked them, and the gateway's routes, which point at localhost in the image and so answer
  "connection refused" to everything until a deployment tells them the real addresses.

### Documentation
- The Helm section of the deployment guide describes the chart as it is: the rule engine it also
  deploys, the password it requires to install at all, the values that matter, and the demo chart.


## [1.0-beta.018] - 2026-08-04

### Added
- **A process is one trace, not one per hop.** OpenTelemetry over OTLP was already wired and the
  documentation said the context propagated across the engine's asynchronous boundaries. It did
  not, for the boundary that matters: that boundary is a database row, not a network call. An event
  is written to the outbox inside the transaction that produced it and published by a relay thread
  afterwards, so auto-instrumentation saw a write in one trace and, later, a Kafka send belonging
  to nothing — and the consumer started a fresh trace. The outbox row now carries the producing
  trace's W3C `traceparent` (`V17`, null when nothing is being traced) and the relay publishes as a
  continuation of it.
- **Engine spans**: `eventconductor.step-over`, `eventconductor.dispatch-step` and
  `eventconductor.correlate-message`, so a trace shows what the engine was doing rather than only
  the queries it made along the way.
- **Metrics over OTLP** (`OTLP_METRICS_ENABLED`), for deployments that already run a collector.
  Off by default, and it does not turn Prometheus scraping off.

All of it through a `WorkflowTracing` port with a no-op default, wired to Micrometer only when the
host brings a `Tracer` — the engine libraries still run with zero observability dependencies, and
a tracing failure is logged at debug rather than being allowed to fail a workflow.

### Documentation
- The observability reference describes the outbox propagation, the engine's spans and the OTLP
  metrics export; the AI reference gained the definition status, per-link preconditions,
  `restartProcess` and the tracing summary; the IDE guide documents the workflow status in the
  graph's Settings panel and that a new `.ec` is written as YAML.

## [1.0-beta.017] - 2026-08-04

Two questions a definition could not answer before: which route into a step a condition belongs to,
and whether the workflow is meant to be running at all.

### Added
- **A precondition carries its own condition.** `preconditions: [{stepId, expression}]` puts a
  guard on the link rather than on the step, so a step reached from two places can require
  something different of each. A link whose condition is false is not satisfied, so the step
  **waits** — the literal reading of "wait for all of them", chosen over quietly dropping the
  branch, which would let a step run having waited for less than its author wrote. Documented
  including the cost: a condition that never becomes true is a process that never finishes, and one
  the stalled-step gauge cannot see. The step-level `preconditionExpression` is unchanged and still
  skips rather than holds.

### Changed
- **A definition says whether it may run, and the runtime cannot overrule it.** `status: ACTIVE |
  DISABLED | ARCHIVED` in the `.ec` is a floor: an operator can take a workflow out of service, but
  cannot put one into service that its own definition closes — which is what lets a definition live
  in a repository without being live. It replaces the `disabled`/`archived` booleans, which between
  them said what one word says; both are still read, in files and in the database.

### Fixed
- **Process creation ignored a disabled workflow.** Only the cron scheduler checked, so anything
  creating a process directly — the UI, an upstream event, an MCP call — walked straight past a
  workflow that had been taken out of service.
- **A git import silently put back into service anything an operator had disabled**, because the
  file and the runtime wrote the same field and whoever wrote last won. They are stored apart now:
  an import replaces the declaration and leaves the runtime decision alone.
- **The graph editor wrote a field the engine could not read.** Its Status dropdown produced
  `status: DRAFT|ACTIVE|DISABLED|ARCHIVED`, which the schema does not define and the importer's
  parser rejects — so such a file did not merely fail to disable anything, it stopped importing
  altogether. The editor now writes the real status, and the importer adopts the older spellings
  rather than choking on them.

### Plugins — IntelliJ 0.1.2, VS Code 0.1.1
- **Delete (or Backspace) removes the selected node or connection**, and deleting a node clears
  every reference to it — preconditions in either spelling, and the compensation pointer that used
  to be left dangling. Connections are selectable at all for the first time.
- **The animation follows the graph you are editing.** Its paths were derived only when the host
  pushed a value in, so an edit made in the editor left it walking the graph as it was before:
  new nodes on no path, deleted ones still on theirs. Selecting a node no longer restarts a paused
  simulation, and a node with nothing wired to it is not animated as a path of its own.
- Readable arrowheads, no expand button in an editor pane that is already the whole surface, a
  Settings panel whose rows line up with their labels, and a new `.ec` written as YAML rather than
  JSON.

### Migration
- `V15` and `V16` add the definition status columns; both are idempotent and run over a `ddl-auto`
  schema. No action beyond the `flyway repair` that 1.0-beta.016 already called for.

## [1.0-beta.016] - 2026-08-04

Tagged without release notes at the time; written down here after the fact.

### Added
- **Definition version history owned by the engine**, with per-version process statistics (#145),
  and a per-repository git subdirectory plus a stopped/waiting heatmap in the definition viewer
  (#144).
- **Run a stopped process again, two ways.** *Retry from failure* picks it up where it stopped;
  *restart from the beginning* re-runs every step, including the ones that succeeded, with the
  variables the process was created with. Both from the process list, the process detail and MCP,
  and both now accept a CANCELLED process and not only a failed one.

### Fixed
- **The engine's own workers were dropping replies.** The forms engine answering a USER_TASK and
  the rule runtime answering a RULE step still called `streamBridge.send` and discarded the
  boolean — the line that left 3 356 processes stuck. Both now reply through `WorkerReply`, and
  the synchronous-producer default that makes a refusal detectable moved to `shared`, so it
  reaches every module that can answer the engine rather than only those that embed it. The demo
  workers too.
- **`DB_POOL_SIZE` and `DB_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT` did nothing.** Every shipped configuration put the
  Hikari settings under `spring.hikari.*`, a prefix Boot binds nothing from, so every deployment
  ran HikariCP's default of 10 connections whatever the environment said. Moving them inside
  `spring.datasource:` makes the documented values real — **the effective pool changes on deploy**.
- **The stalled-step gauge counted people.** `eventconductor.steps.stalled` counted every live step
  with no deadline, which is what a human task is by design, so any deployment with USER_TASK steps
  reported permanent stalled work and warned about it every minute. Only ACTION and RULE steps —
  the ones a worker owes an answer for — are counted now.
- **The documented upgrade path did not run.** Adopting Flyway over a schema `ddl-auto` had already
  built failed at `V11`, which added columns the entity already declares and dropped columns
  Hibernate never created; the application did not start. Both shapes migrate now, and
  `DdlAutoToFlywayUpgradeTest` runs the whole chain over a Hibernate-built schema.

  :warning: **Action required on databases where `V11` already ran successfully.** Editing an
  applied migration changes its checksum, and Flyway validates checksums at startup: those
  databases need a one-off `flyway repair` before the application will start. Databases that never
  got past `V11` — the broken path this fixes — need nothing.
- Path focus (click and alt+click) works again in the process view of the workflow graph.

## [1.0-beta.015] - 2026-08-03

### Fixed
- **The transactional outbox was not transactional: 71 messages in 642 912 were marked `Sent` and
  never reached the broker.** The relay delivers before marking the row, which is the right order
  and bought nothing, because the send was asynchronous — `StreamBridge.send` returns `true` the
  moment the record is buffered, so a broker that was down still produced a row marked `Sent` and
  a process that never moved again. Producer sends are now synchronous by default, contributed by
  the engine itself (`SynchronousProducerDefaults`) rather than left to each application's YAML,
  and a refused send throws so the row stays `Pending`. Measured cost: **0.6 ms per transition and
  4.4% of peak throughput**. Set `spring.cloud.stream.kafka.default.producer.sync=false` to opt
  out, deliberately.

- **Workers were dropping replies, in the pattern this project teaches.** Every worker here called
  `streamBridge.send(...)` and discarded the `false` it returns on refusal, so a reply the broker
  would not take vanished, the consumer committed the offset anyway, and the task was never
  reported as done. During a 90-second broker outage that lost **3 352 replies and left 3 356
  processes permanently stuck, with no error logged anywhere**. New `WorkerReply` retries and then
  throws, so Kafka redelivers the task — worker handlers must be idempotent, as at-least-once
  delivery always required.

- **A step with no timeout was invisible, not merely un-timed-out.** The deadline scan is an index
  range over the deadline column, so a step without one was never looked at again: if its dispatch
  or its reply was lost, the process stopped forever and nothing reported it. Two changes — the
  `eventconductor.steps.stalled` gauge counts live steps with no deadline that have waited past
  `workflow.stalled-step-after-ms`, and `workflow.default-step-timeout-ms` gives ACTION and RULE
  steps a fallback deadline that hands them to the existing retry path. Off by default; never
  applied to USER_TASK, PROCESS or WAIT_FOR_MESSAGE, whose waiting is unbounded by design.

- **A rollback the database made impossible was treated as a defective event.** Stopping
  PostgreSQL mid-transaction produced `JpaSystemException: Unable to rollback against JDBC
  Connection`, which the classifier did not recognise as retryable, and two process creations were
  dead-lettered for it. Connection-level `SQLException`s are now matched on SQLState — class `08`,
  class `53`, PostgreSQL `57P01`–`57P03` — as well as by type. A constraint violation stays
  non-retryable: retrying that forever is a poison pill.

- **`forms` and `rules` still shipped with Flyway off.** Only the orchestrator had been fixed, so
  both ran the schema `ddl-auto` builds, which has no indexes. Both now default `FLYWAY_ENABLED`
  to `true`. `DB_POOL_SIZE` defaults to 16 across the three apps.

- **One consumer thread per pod meant a deployment could never use more partitions than replicas.**
  `KAFKA_CONCURRENCY` now defaults to 3. Measured on a three-pod cluster with six partitions: four
  consumed, two unread, and no pod anywhere near CPU-bound.

- **PostgreSQL and Redpanda declared no resource requests**, which makes them BestEffort and the
  first pods the kubelet evicts. Scaling the orchestrator from 3 to 6 replicas evicted the broker
  and stopped the engine completely. Both now have requests and limits in the chart.

- **Redpanda's shard count is pinned (`--smp`).** It is written into the data directory as an
  invariant, so a broker rescheduled onto a smaller node refuses to start — permanently — with
  "Decreasing redpanda core count is not allowed". On any cluster with a node autoprovisioner that
  turns a routine reschedule into an outage.

- **Two migrations shared version 11**, which makes Flyway refuse to start and the app die at boot
  with no schema. Both branches had merged green because nothing on the build path reads these
  filenames. A test does now.

### Added
- **A reliability harness** (`modules/workflow-benchmark/k8s/reliability`): a soak driver, seven
  chaos scenarios — pod kill, whole-tier kill, rolling redeploy, broker outage, database outage,
  node drain, and replacing the workflow definition mid-flight — and the invariants that decide
  whether anything was lost. The verdict is computed from the engine's own tables against a count
  the driver writes to the database, because the harness is inside the blast radius.

  Results after the fixes: **zero stuck processes** (3 356 before), a full drain in 144 s (it never
  drained before), zero duplicate step executions across 230 417 dispatches including 44 genuine
  redeliveries, and the definition swap producing exactly two shapes and no hybrids. See the new
  [Reliability guide](https://eventconductor.io/guides/reliability/).

### Fixed
- **Flyway runs by default.** `FLYWAY_ENABLED` defaulted to `false` while `DDL_AUTO` defaulted to
  `update`, so the out-of-the-box standalone app built its schema with Hibernate and never ran the
  migrations — and the migrations are the only place the engine's indexes come from, since
  `ddl-auto=update` emits no index DDL. The default deployment therefore ran every deadline scan,
  outbox claim and message correlation as a sequential scan.

  Enabling it is safe on a schema `ddl-auto` already created: it baselines at V1 and every later
  migration is written with `IF NOT EXISTS`. **Existing installs that override
  `flywayEnabled: false` should turn it back on** — the Helm chart already defaults it to true, so
  this only bites deployments that overrode it or run the app without the chart. Turn Flyway on
  first, confirm the indexes appear, and only then move `ddlAuto` to `validate`.

- **The demo services had the shared-consumer-group defect too.** `content-service` and
  `users-service` used one group for their `upstream` and `outbox` bindings, same as the
  orchestrator did.

- **A consumer group per binding. Sharing one left Kafka partitions with no consumer at all.**
  The orchestrator's two bindings — `upstream` and `outbox` — used the same group, so its members
  had different topic subscriptions. The default range assignor handles that badly: observed on a
  cluster, 12 members held 7 of 12 partitions between them, and the 5 unassigned ones were simply
  never read. Every process whose next event landed there stopped, and the pods sat near idle
  while work piled up.

  It was never visible locally because the suite is short and a rebalance eventually reshuffles
  the gap onto a consumer. It was costing throughput the whole time: DIST-05 goes from ~60 to
  **78–91 PI/s** with nothing changed but the group names.

  Fixed in the standalone app, the distributed harness and the benchmark. Anyone running their own
  orchestrator wiring should check the same thing: a consumer group's members must subscribe to
  the same topics.

- **Indexes are declared on the entities, not only in the migrations.** They only ever existed in
  Flyway, so a schema built by `ddl-auto` had primary keys and nothing else, and every deadline
  scan, outbox claim and correlation lookup became a sequential scan. On a cluster with ~9k live
  step rows that pinned PostgreSQL at 750m of CPU.

  **`ddl-auto=update` still will not create them** — Hibernate's update path emits no index DDL,
  which is worth knowing before relying on it. `create` and `create-drop` do, so the test
  harnesses now exercise the same plan as production. For a real deployment the migrations remain
  the answer, and `spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update` is not a substitute for running them.

### Changed
- **The relay is woken by the write instead of finding out on its next poll.** A pod that commits
  an outbox row raises a signal its own relay is waiting on; the poll interval stays as the
  fallback for rows written by other pods, which a pod has no way to hear about directly.

  The poll interval was never a scheduling preference — it was latency added to every step, and a
  transition crosses the relay twice. Measured on the benchmark harness at 40 instances/s, p50 per
  transition:

  | `workflow.outbox-poll-interval-ms` | before | after |
  |---|---|---|
  | 500 (the shipped default) | 508,8 ms | **10,1 ms** |
  | 20 | 28,6 ms | **10,7 ms** |

  Fifty times at the default, and still nearly three times better than the most aggressive polling
  worth running — which also stops mattering, since the interval no longer sets the latency.

  The signal fires **after the commit**, not at the write: raised inside the transaction it would
  wake the relay to look for a row not yet visible, which finds nothing, goes back to waiting, and
  spends the wakeup — leaving exactly the latency it exists to remove, with an extra query on top.
  It carries one permit rather than a count, because the relay drains until empty and only needs
  to know that something arrived.

### Fixed
- **An event that lost an optimistic race is now redelivered instead of disappearing.** The
  rejection was caught, counted, logged as "the event will be redelivered" — and then the handler
  returned normally, the consumer committed its offset, and the event was gone. Nothing redelivered
  it. The log line was simply wrong. A rejection now propagates as
  `ConcurrentProcessAccessException` all the way out of the consumer, which is what actually stops
  the offset from advancing over work that never happened. It is deliberately the one failure that
  is not swallowed: the event is not defective, it just lost a race, so retrying is the right
  answer rather than a log line.

- **An event the engine cannot process is parked instead of vanishing into a log line.** It used
  to be caught inside the event use cases, logged once, and forgotten: never retried, never
  visible, and invisible to anyone not reading that log. Those catches are gone. A failure now
  reaches whoever delivered the event, which is the only place that can decide what to do with it,
  because the answer depends on how it arrived.

  **The policy is retry forever, or park at once — never "retry N times, then give up".** N
  attempts is a guess about how long an outage lasts, and getting the guess wrong drops events
  that would have worked. `EventFailures` decides: only failures known to be about the
  environment — database unreachable, lock not obtained, a lost race — are retryable, and the
  classification is deliberately narrow because being wrong towards parking is the safer
  direction. A parked event can be replayed once someone understands it; an event retried for
  ever is a loop nobody reads.

  Where it parks depends on the topology, because the two have different queues. In `kafka` mode
  it goes to a **dead-letter topic** (`deadLetter` binding), payload untouched so replaying is
  just republishing it on the destination its `x-dead-letter-source` header names, with the
  failure in headers and the process still as the key. In `embedded` mode the outbox table *is*
  the queue, so the resting place is its existing `Error` status — visible in the table, replayed
  by setting the row back to `Pending`. That path also fixes a quieter bug: a failed message was
  left `Pending`, so an event that could never succeed was retried every cycle for ever.

  New counter `eventconductor.events.dead.lettered` — the one that should make somebody look, since
  a retry is the engine coping and a dead letter is the engine giving up. Specs `DIST-12` and
  `E2E-DLQ-01`.

### Changed
- **A Kafka poll batch is committed as one transaction per process, not one per event.** A busy
  batch carries several events for the same process, and collapsing those into a single commit is
  most of the write cost. Measured on DIST-05, three runs: **56,8 / 60,3 / 56,8 PI/s against
  50,8 / 51,0 / 53,7** before — about 12% on wall clock and 20% on the engine-side window.
  Consumers switch to batch mode (`batch-mode: true` on the two orchestrator bindings; turning it
  off falls back to one transaction per event).

  **Per process, not per batch — and that distinction is the whole design.** One transaction for
  the entire batch is the obvious shape and it is a trap: an event that fails inside its own
  participating transaction marks the shared one rollback-only *even when the failure is caught*,
  so every other event in the batch loses the commit it believed it had. The failure that makes
  this concrete is an optimistic conflict, which is precisely what a consumer-group rebalance
  produces — the moment the engine is least settled would be the moment it threw away the most
  work. Measured both ways: the two perform the same, so the batch-wide version buys nothing for
  its blast radius. `BatchTransactionScopeTest` pins the trap; `DIST-12` covers the behaviour.

  Events of a process keep their arrival order, and an event belonging to no process gets a
  transaction of its own so it neither drags others down nor is dragged down by them.
- **No per-process lock in `kafka` mode: exclusivity is inherited from the partition.** Events are
  keyed by process and a consumer group gives each partition to exactly one consumer, so a process
  already has a single writer. `PartitionOwnedProcessLockService` therefore only opens the
  transaction the work commits in; the optimistic version is what guards the rebalance window.

  Measured on DIST-05, three runs each: **44,0 / 46,1 / 50,7 PI/s with the row lock against
  50,8 / 51,0 / 53,7 without** — about 10% on the mean, and a visibly tighter spread, since the
  lock was the part that could wait. The lowest run without it beat the highest run with it.

  **`embedded` mode keeps the row lock**, deliberately: nothing partitions processes across pods
  there, so two of them can still reach the same process, and a version guards a *row* rather than
  a *decision* — two step-overs that read the same state and then write different rows collide on
  no version and would dispatch a step twice.

  That same reasoning left one hole in kafka mode, and it is closed rather than documented away:
  a worker on an older shared module reports back **unkeyed**, so its event can land on a pod that
  does not own the process. `UnkeyedEventRouter` now sends such an event back out with the process
  it belongs to instead of handling it where it landed — one indexed lookup and one extra hop,
  paid only by workers that do not echo the process, and inert outside kafka mode.
- **Operator actions travel as events, so they run on the pod that owns the process.** Pausing,
  resuming, cancelling and retrying (a whole process or one step) used to execute wherever the UI
  click or the MCP call landed — which, under partition ownership, is not the pod that owns the
  process. They are now published keyed by the process: `PauseProcessRequested`,
  `ResumeProcessRequested`, `RetryProcessRequested`, `RetryStepExecutionRequested`, and the
  long-declared but never-used `ProcessCancellationRequested`, which gains a `processId` because a
  process with no business key cannot be addressed by one. An operator action goes through the
  same single writer as everything else instead of being the one path that needs a lock to be safe.

  **In embedded mode nothing changes:** the upstream publisher dispatches in-process, so a UI
  action is still carried out synchronously before the call returns. It is only in `kafka` mode
  that these become routed — and there the MCP tools now answer "requested… query the process to
  see the outcome" rather than claiming the work is done.

  There are no REST endpoints for these operations; the entry points are the UI and MCP.
  Specs `E2E-OPS-01..05`.
- **Optimistic locking on `Process` and `StepExecution`.** Both aggregates now carry a `version`,
  checked on every write (migration `V11`, existing rows backfilled to 0 — a null version is how
  Spring Data recognises a row it has never persisted, so leaving them null would turn updates
  into failed inserts).

  This is the fence for the one hole in ownership. Keying events by process gives each process to
  a single pod, but a consumer group guarantees which consumer is *assigned* a partition, not
  which is still *in flight*: during a rebalance the outgoing pod can be finishing a record the
  incoming one has just been handed. A stale writer's update now matches no row at its version
  and is rejected, rather than quietly overwriting the new owner's work.

  It costs nothing when there is no conflict — no waiting, no lock held, no connection parked —
  which is what makes it able to replace the pessimistic lock rather than sit beside it.

  **Rejections are counted, not just logged**: `eventconductor.process.concurrent.writes.rejected`.
  That metric is the point of this change as much as the safety is. Outside a rebalance it must be
  flat at zero; anything else means something is reaching a process from outside its partition —
  exactly what has to be true before the pessimistic lock can be removed. Specs `E2E-LOCK-01..03`.
- **Events are keyed by process, so a process belongs to one pod.** Every event that concerns a
  process now carries it as the Kafka message key (`DomainEvent.partitionKey()`), so all of a
  process's events hash to the same partition — and a consumer group gives each partition to
  exactly one consumer. Per-process serialization stops being something the engine arranges after
  the fact and becomes a property of how events are addressed.

  **This also fixes ordering, which is a correctness matter rather than a performance one.** On an
  unkeyed topic two events of the same process land on different partitions and are handled
  concurrently by different pods, in whatever order they arrive; the per-process lock serialized
  access but never ordered it. What made that survivable was the terminal-status guards and the
  re-reads inside the lock. Keyed, the order is the order they were produced in.

  Two events that mutate process state carried only a task id and now carry the process too:
  `TaskStatusChanged` (a worker's reply, echoed from the `TaskExecutionRequested` it received) and
  `StepExecutionStatusChanged`. Both keep their previous constructor, which leaves the key null —
  so a third-party worker built against an older shared module still compiles, still deserializes,
  and simply falls back to the unrouted behaviour it has today. Events that write only their own
  independent row (`TaskLogEmitted`, `TaskResourceCreated`) stay unkeyed on purpose: pinning them
  to a partition would cost balance and buy nothing.

  Nothing is removed yet — the per-process lock stays as the safety net, since ownership is only
  a Kafka *assignment* guarantee and a rebalance can still put two pods on one process briefly.
  New spec `DIST-11` verifies the keys by reading the topics, not by trusting that `send` set one.
- **BREAKING (SPI): per-process exclusion is a row lock, not an advisory lock.**
  `ProcessLockService` loses `tryLock`/`unlock` and gains a single
  `runExclusively(processId, action)`. In JPA mode the action now runs in a transaction that opens
  by taking `SELECT … FOR UPDATE` on the process row, and the commit releases it. Anyone who
  implemented this port has to follow; nothing else about the engine's concurrency semantics
  changes.

  The reason is not elegance. An advisory lock is session-scoped, so acquiring it took a
  connection out of the pool and **held it for the whole critical section**, while the work inside
  needed a second one. Two connections per in-flight process made the pool size — not the database
  — the ceiling on concurrency, and past that point the failure was a **wedge, not a slowdown**:
  lock holders waiting for a connection to do the work they held the lock for. New spec `DIST-10`
  pins this down: 40 concurrent processes complete through a 3-connection pool, and restoring the
  two-connection shape exhausts it and stalls the processes outright.

  What else falls out: the stale-lock watchdog is gone, and with it the chance of force-releasing
  exclusivity from an operation still running; `ProcessLocks.lockWithRetry` is gone, because
  waiting is now the database's row-lock queue rather than a sleep-and-retry loop that reopened a
  connection on every attempt; exclusivity is reentrant within a transaction; and the lock key is
  the process id itself rather than a 64-bit fold of its UUID. Waiting is bounded by
  `workflow.process-lock-timeout-seconds` (default 10), applied as a statement timeout, which is
  portable in a way that per-vendor lock-timeout settings are not.

  `UpdateStepExecutionUseCase` drops its own `TransactionTemplate`: exclusivity and the
  transaction are now the same scope, so the inner one only joined the outer.
- **Every pod relays the outbox now — it is no longer a leader-elected singleton.** In `kafka`
  mode one pod drained the whole outbox while the others idled, and since every state transition
  passes through the relay, that put a ceiling on the distributed topology that adding pods could
  not lift. Relays now claim bounded batches with `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`, so N orchestrators
  drain N disjoint slices with no leader between them. New spec `DIST-09` proves the claims are
  disjoint, non-blocking and complete, against real PostgreSQL.

  The at-least-once contract is unchanged: a batch is claimed, published and marked `Sent` in one
  transaction, publishing still happens *before* the rows are marked, and a crash anywhere in
  between rolls back and releases the locks so another pod redelivers.

  Three related fixes in the same path: the relay **no longer loads the entire pending outbox**
  on every cycle (bounded batch, new `workflow.outbox.batch-size`, default 100) but keeps draining
  until it is empty so a backlog is not paced by the poll interval; per-message logging drops from
  `INFO` to `DEBUG`; and `workflow.outbox-poll-interval-ms` **defaults to 500 ms instead of
  5000** — it used to add up to five seconds of idle latency to every step hop in `kafka` mode,
  and the published DIST-05 throughput baseline was only ever reachable by overriding it.
  Migration `V10` indexes `(status, timestamp)`, which the claim's ordering needs.

  The **embedded** relay deliberately keeps its leader lock: its "delivery" is the engine running
  a step synchronously, taking the process lock and its own connections, and holding row locks and
  a transaction across all of that would mean long transactions and a plausible deadlock against
  the very work being dispatched. It does take the bounded fetch and the log-level fix.

  The relay's old advisory lock survives as a **shared** gate that every relay holds while
  draining: shared holders do not block each other, so this costs nothing, but a single exclusive
  holder still freezes every relay at once — the deterministic crash window DIST-02 and DIST-08
  are built on.
- **An arriving message finds its waiting steps by index.** A live `WAIT_FOR_MESSAGE` step now
  stores the subscription it represents — `awaiting_message_name` and `awaiting_correlation_key`
  — so correlating a `MessageReceived` is a lookup on those two columns instead of a walk over
  every step waiting anywhere in the engine, loading each one's process and evaluating its JEXL
  expression. Indexing the message name alone would not have helped: the case that hurts is many
  processes parked on the *same* message, where the key is the only selective part.

  **The correlation contract is unchanged**, and that is what most of the work went into. The key
  derives from process variables, and those move while a step waits — a parallel branch can write
  the very variable the expression reads. Evaluating on arrival made that free; storing it does
  not, so both paths that update process variables now rearm the subscriptions of that one
  process (`MessageSubscriptionService`), writing only the keys that actually moved. A message
  still correlates against the process as it is *now*. Spec `E2E-MSG-06` covers it. Fail-closed
  survives too: an expression that will not evaluate stores a null key, and null matches nothing.
  `CompleteMessageStepHandler` still re-checks the correlation against the live process under the
  process lock — the query is the filter, that check remains the decision.

  Steps already waiting when this version is deployed are armed at the next boot by
  `InFlightStepRearmRunner` (which also covers the deadline below). Migration `V9` adds the
  columns and `idx_step_exec_awaiting_message`.
- **The scheduler no longer walks every live step to find the due ones.** Each step execution now
  carries a **materialised deadline** (`deadline_at`) — a `TIMER`'s due moment or a step's timeout
  — armed when the step starts, from the `startedAt`, variables and step JSON that are frozen at
  that instant. The scheduler asks for `deadline_at <= now` over a new index instead of loading
  every PENDING/RUNNING step and re-evaluating each one on every tick. The cost of a tick now
  tracks *what is due* — normally nothing — rather than *what is waiting*, which is what the
  engine's own use case is made of: a check-in reminder is a `TIMER` sitting PENDING for weeks,
  and it used to be re-examined every ten seconds for all of them.

  The deadline is derived state, so it is recomputed by every path that moves the clock;
  `withDeadlineAt` is suppressed on the aggregate so it cannot be set on its own, and pause/resume
  (which shifts `startedAt` by the pause duration) moves both together. Steps already in flight
  when this version is deployed are armed at the next boot by `InFlightStepRearmRunner`, which
  recomputes them from the state they already carry — one query at startup, idempotent, a no-op
  from then on. Migration `V8` adds the column and `idx_step_exec_deadline`.

  No behaviour change, with one millisecond-scale exception: a step timeout falling exactly on the
  tick now fires on that tick instead of the next, matching what `TIMER` already did.

### Fixed
- **Timer and timeout checks no longer load every live step in the system.** `CheckTimerUseCase`
  and `CheckTimeoutUseCase` listed *all* PENDING/RUNNING step executions and filtered them by
  process in memory. Because the scheduler scan fans out one check event per due process, a
  single scan tick that found N due processes triggered N full loads of the live-step table, on
  top of its own. Both now query only the process they were commanded for, through a new
  `StepExecutionRepository.findPendingOrRunningByProcessId(processId)`. The cost matters most on
  the workloads the engine is built for — long waits, where tens of thousands of `TIMER` steps
  sit PENDING for weeks. New composite index `idx_step_exec_process_status` on
  `step_execution_entity (process_id, status)` replaces the process-only index it subsumes
  (migration `V7`). No behaviour change.

## [1.0-beta.014] - 2026-08-01

### Added
- **IDE plugins for VS Code and IntelliJ IDEA.** New editor plugins (under `plugins/`) open a
  workflow definition as an **interactive graph** or as plain **YAML/JSON**, both views editing the
  same file, with schema validation, and they embed the exact graph web component the app renders.
  VS Code ships a custom editor (graph by default, *Show YAML/JSON side-by-side*); IntelliJ
  (2024.2+) ships a split graph/text editor via JCEF. Published to the VS Code and JetBrains
  marketplaces. See [IDE Plugins](/guides/ide-plugins/).
- **`.ec` — a first-class workflow-definition extension.** An `.ec` file holds a definition as
  **JSON or YAML** (detected from the content and preserved on save). The git import and the
  classpath importer now read `.ec` alongside `.json` / `.yaml` / `.yml`.
- **JOIN gains an AND/XOR type.** A `JOIN` now carries a `joinType`: **`AND`** (default) is a
  synchronizing join that waits for all incoming branches; **`XOR`** is an exclusive join that
  proceeds as soon as any one completes. Null/absent = `AND`, so existing definitions are
  unaffected. The precondition check honours it (all-match for AND, any-match for XOR).
- **Live process state on the in-app graphs (read-only monitoring).** The workflow-definition view
  badges each node with how many live process instances currently sit on it; the process view gains
  a *Diagram* tab that shows the graph with the active step highlighted and the parts not yet
  reached dimmed. Driven by a new `overlay` property on the graph component.
- **Workflow graph editor — major UX pass.** Zoom/pan with fit-to-view and a minimap; dark-mode
  support outside Lumo (for the IDE webviews); BPMN-style event/gateway shapes with an
  exclusive-gateway (`×`) glyph for XOR joins; a token-flow simulation that dwells on long-running
  steps and, on an AND-join, lights up all its incoming branches to show it synchronising;
  node-avoiding, non-overlapping, shape-fitting edge routing; and drawing precondition lines by
  Shift+drag. The same built bundle is reused by both IDE plugins.
- **Whole-process saga rollback in reverse execution order.** When any step fails or times out
  after exhausting its retries, the engine now compensates **every executed compensable step**
  (completed steps plus the one that just failed) — not only the failed step's own
  compensation — running them **sequentially, in reverse execution order**: the latest-executed
  step is undone first, and each compensation starts only once the previous one completes. The
  next compensation is derived purely from persisted step-execution state (new
  `CompensationService`), so it is idempotent under redelivery and across restarts. A single
  failed compensable step is just the degenerate case of this cascade. See the new
  `COMPENSATED` terminal state under Changed.
- **Git reload webhook: multiple providers, targeted reload and pruning.** The
  `POST /{engine}/webhooks/{provider}` endpoint (workflow, forms and rule engines) now accepts
  `github`, `gitlab`, `bitbucket` and `generic` (`/github` keeps its behaviour), each
  authenticated with the configured `webhook-secret` — GitHub/Bitbucket HMAC-SHA256
  (`X-Hub-Signature-256`/`X-Hub-Signature`), GitLab (`X-Gitlab-Token`) and generic
  (`X-Webhook-Token`) tokens; a blank secret skips verification. The push payload is parsed to
  reload **only the repository and branch that changed** (an unmatched push is acknowledged and
  ignored; an unparseable payload falls back to reloading everything). Shared, reusable helpers
  live in a new `io.mateu.workflow.webhook` package. See pruning under Changed.
- **Workflow graph editor: multiple incoming preconditions per step.** The graph now renders
  and edits several `preconditionStepIds` into a single step (one edge per precondition, a
  multi-select editor) — the engine already honoured them; only the editor had modelled a
  single incoming edge.
- **Workflow graph editor: restyled, more expressive SVG.** The graph is redrawn in a richer
  visual language on the same Lit + ELK stack: per-type node cards with a corner glyph and an
  uppercase caption (`→ topic`, `👤 form`, `ƒ rule`, `⨝ JOIN`, `✉→ message`, …), dashed
  `FORK`/`JOIN` gateways, orthogonal rounded edges with arrowheads, a themeable palette
  (`--ec-*` custom properties, with a Lumo dark-mode mapping), and a step's
  `preconditionExpression` guard shown as a chip on its incoming edge.

### Changed
- **At most one `START` per workflow.** More than one `START` step is now rejected at validation.
  Multiple `END` steps remain valid — a flow may finish through several distinct outcomes.
- **Gateway-model guidance (warnings, not errors).** The validator now logs non-fatal warnings
  nudging a multi-input step toward a `JOIN` (with explicit AND/XOR semantics) and a multi-output
  step toward a `FORK`. Compensation anchors are excluded and conditional (guarded) splits stay
  allowed; it never blocks a definition.
- **BREAKING: a fully compensated process ends `COMPENSATED`, not `ERROR`.** A failed process
  that runs its saga rollback to completion now reaches the new terminal
  `ProcessStatus.COMPENSATED` instead of remaining `ERROR`; if a compensation itself fails
  after its retries, the chain halts and the process stays `ERROR`. `COMPENSATED` is a sticky
  terminal failure state (like `ERROR`), distinguished by whether the side effects were undone.
  Consumers, queries and dashboards that treat `ERROR` as the only failure terminal — and a
  parent `PROCESS` step, which now also errors on a `COMPENSATED` child — should account for
  the new state.
- **BREAKING: the git reload webhook reloads a subset and prunes removed definitions.**
  Previously every webhook call re-imported **all** configured repositories and only
  added/updated definitions. It now reloads only the repository and branch named in the push,
  and definitions that were removed from a repo are **pruned** — workflow definitions are
  archived (`ARCHIVED`), forms and rules are deleted (git-imported definitions only, never
  classpath or hand-authored ones; tracked per running instance). Only definitions with an
  explicit `id` are prune-tracked.

## [1.0-beta.013] - 2026-07-31

Cumulative since `1.0-beta.010` — releases `1.0-beta.011` and `1.0-beta.012` were cut
without changelog sections, so their contents are included below.

### Added
- **Pause/play for processes and workflow definitions.** New `ProcessStatus.PAUSED`:
  `PauseProcessUseCase` pauses a `PENDING`/`RUNNING` process and `ResumeProcessUseCase`
  puts it back to `RUNNING`. Pause freezes the frontier, not in-flight work — running
  workers finish and their reports are accepted (steps complete, variables merge), and
  messages still complete `WAIT_FOR_MESSAGE` steps — but successors do not start until
  resume. Clocks freeze too: timeout and TIMER scanning skip paused processes and, on
  resume, every non-terminal started step's `startedAt` is shifted forward by the pause
  duration (recorded in the new `Process.pausedAt`), so step timeouts and timer
  due-moments resume where they left off; blocking-error handling is deferred the same
  way, and cancelling from `PAUSED` works. At the definition level, a new runtime
  `paused` flag (orthogonal to the `DRAFT`/`ACTIVE`/... lifecycle; in the schema as
  nullable boolean, default `false`, so exports round-trip): `PauseWorkflowUseCase` sets
  it and pauses all the definition's `PENDING`/`RUNNING` processes, while new instances —
  cron occurrences included — are still accepted and created **born-`PAUSED`**;
  `ResumeWorkflowUseCase` clears it and resumes all its `PAUSED` processes. Surface:
  **Pause**/**Resume** toolbar actions on the process detail and on the definition detail
  (plus a **Paused** row), and four MCP tools — `pauseProcess`, `resumeProcess`,
  `pauseWorkflow`, `resumeWorkflow`. Flyway migration V6 in the orchestrator app
  (`process_entity.paused_at`, `workflow_definition_entity.paused`).
- **`START` step type — explicit workflow entry points.** A no-worker node that completes
  instantly at process creation, fanning the flow out to its successors. A `START` must have
  no preconditions, and declaring several gives the process concurrent entry branches. Every
  flow must now enter through a `START` or a `WAIT_FOR_MESSAGE` (see the roots rule under
  Changed).
- **`FORK` and `JOIN` are now implemented, on multi-preconditions.** Steps gain
  `preconditionStepIds` (array): ALL the listed steps must complete before the step starts;
  the singular `preconditionStepId` remains valid (the plural wins when both are set). `FORK`
  and `JOIN` are no-worker nodes that complete instantly — `FORK` is the explicit fan-out
  (all its successors start concurrently when it completes), and `JOIN`'s barrier is exactly
  its multiple preconditions (the converge point of parallel branches). Precondition-cycle
  detection is now a DFS over the multi-edge graph. The Maven plugin emits a build-time
  warning (never a failure) when a `JOIN` waits directly on a guarded step — if the guard is
  false the join never fires and the flow beyond it is cancelled.
- **`PROCESS` step type — child workflows are now implemented.** A `PROCESS` step (required
  `childWorkflowDefinitionId`, which must differ from the workflow's own id) starts a child
  process carrying ALL parent variables under the deterministic businessKey
  `parent:<stepExecutionId>` — idempotent, duplicate creation events are deduped. The parent
  step waits `PENDING`; when the child completes, the parent step completes and copies back
  only the child variables named in the new `outputVariables` step field (absent/empty =
  none); a child ending `ERROR` or `CANCELLED` puts the parent step in `ERROR` (normal
  retry/compensation pipeline), and `timeout` bounds the wait. `Process` gains
  `parentStepExecutionId` (Flyway migration V5 in the orchestrator app). Cancellation
  propagates parent→child: a parent `PROCESS` step ending `CANCELLED`, `ERROR` or `TIMEOUT`
  (retries exhausted) cancels a still-running child, cascading to grandchildren; while
  retries remain the child keeps running and a retried step re-attaches to it through the
  deterministic business key.
- **Graph and build-time validation support for the new model.** The workflow graph renders
  multi-precondition edges and `START`/`FORK`/`JOIN` nodes, and the Maven plugin's
  `SpecValidator` mirrors all the new invariants (roots rule, START-without-preconditions,
  plural precondition references, multi-edge DFS cycle detection, the PROCESS child id).
- **`SEND_MESSAGE` step type — fire-and-forget in-engine messaging.** The throw side of
  `WAIT_FOR_MESSAGE`: on start the engine evaluates the step's `correlationExpression` (JEXL,
  same context as preconditions), emits a `MessageReceived(messageName, correlationKey,
  variables)` through the outbox and completes the step immediately — no worker, no `ACTION`
  step needed for process-to-process signaling. The new optional `messageVariables` field
  (array of process-variable names) selects which variables the outgoing message carries;
  empty or absent means none — process state is never sent implicitly. Delivery is not
  acknowledged and a message matching no waiting process is discarded (not buffered). A
  missing `messageName`/`correlationExpression` or an unevaluable correlation key puts the
  step in `ERROR` (fail loud, normal retry/compensation pipeline) — deliberately not the
  silent fail-closed of precondition guards. The Maven plugin's `SpecValidator` now also
  checks `correlationExpression` JEXL syntax at build time.
- **`message-received` deliverable via the Kafka `upstream` topic.** `MessageReceived` is now a
  registered `DomainEvent` subtype (`"type": "message-received"`), so external producers can
  resume waiting `WAIT_FOR_MESSAGE` steps by publishing raw JSON to `upstream` — previously
  only REST (`POST /workflow/api/messages`), the MCP `sendMessage` tool or the Java API could.
- **Engine observability — metrics parity across all engines.** The Micrometer metrics pattern
  that already existed in the workflow engine (an `application/out` port with no-op defaults, a
  Micrometer implementation in `autoconfigure`, and an autoconfiguration guarded on a
  `MeterRegistry` bean) has been mirrored into the other engines. Metrics stay inert unless the
  host application provides a `MeterRegistry` (e.g. via Spring Boot Actuator), so libraries still
  run with zero observability dependencies.
  - **forms-engine** (`FormsMetrics`): `eventconductor.forms.task.created`,
    `eventconductor.forms.task.completed`, `eventconductor.forms.task.cancelled`,
    `eventconductor.forms.task.duration`, `eventconductor.forms.imported`.
  - **rule-engine** (`RuleCatalogMetrics`): `eventconductor.rule.catalog.saved`,
    `eventconductor.rule.catalog.deleted`, `eventconductor.rule.catalog.imported`,
    `eventconductor.rule.catalog.served`.
  - **rule-runtime** (`RuleRuntimeMetrics`): `eventconductor.rule.evaluation.count`,
    `eventconductor.rule.evaluation.duration`, `eventconductor.rule.evaluation.cache`. The
    runtime keeps working as a plain (non-Spring) library — the metrics port defaults to a no-op
    via overloaded constructors.
- **Distributed tracing (OpenTelemetry over OTLP).** The `orchestrator`, `forms` and `rule`
  standalone apps now ship `micrometer-tracing-bridge-otel` + `opentelemetry-exporter-otlp` and
  expose `management.tracing` / `management.otlp.tracing` configuration. Tracing is **off by
  default** (`TRACING_SAMPLING=0.0`); set `TRACING_SAMPLING` and `OTLP_TRACING_ENDPOINT` to emit
  spans. Because it is enabled at the app layer, HTTP, Kafka (Spring Cloud Stream) and JDBC calls
  are auto-instrumented and trace context propagates across the engines' async boundaries without
  any engine-code changes — consistent with the metrics' "optional, host-activated" design.
- **Observability docs** — the docs site gains a dedicated Reference → Observability page
  (`doc/src/content/docs/reference/observability.md`) covering the metrics of every engine
  (workflow, forms, rule catalog, rule runtime) plus a Distributed tracing section (how to
  enable Prometheus scraping and OTLP tracing); the Configuration reference keeps a short
  pointer to it.
- **Boot without the database and resume when it appears.** `DbLockDialectFactory` was the only
  startup-time database access left: it now falls back to inferring the lock dialect from the
  JDBC url when the database is unreachable (the pollers already retry every tick), so an
  orchestrator configured for resilience (lazy pool, `ddl-auto: none`, explicit dialect) boots
  in seconds with PostgreSQL down, and a process parked mid-flight with pending outbox rows
  completes once the database returns. Proven by a new distributed chaos test (DIST-08) that
  pauses/resumes PostgreSQL with `docker pause`, like the Kafka chaos tests.
- **REST endpoint to deliver messages to `MESSAGE` steps.** `POST /workflow/api/messages`
  publishes a `MessageReceived` through the same upstream surface as Kafka, the embedded
  publisher and the `sendMessage` MCP tool, so webhooks and SaaS callbacks that cannot produce
  to Kafka can resume waiting `MESSAGE` steps. Fire-and-forget (`202 Accepted`), with an
  optional `X-Api-Key` guard configured via `workflow.message-api.api-key`.
- **Read-only workflow definition detail view with graph.** Selecting a definition in the CRUD
  now opens a dedicated `WorkflowDefinitionDetailView` (the "view" action) instead of the
  editor: name as the title, lifecycle status as a header badge, a compact property list and a
  read-only ELK graph side by side, with the steps as a full-width band below. The editor
  layouts were tidied (5-column definition grid; the Step form's Main / Precondition /
  Execution / Reliability sections sit side by side), a `PROCESS` step can no longer pick the
  workflow it belongs to as its child, and the graph component gains a read-only mode (toolbar
  and node-detail panel hidden, capped height with a full-screen expand button).
- **Lifecycle actions on the detail view + Export YAML.** The read-only detail view now carries
  the full lifecycle toolbar (*Promote to production*, *Create working copy*, *Disable*,
  *Enable*, *Reactivate*, *Archive*) with the same visibility rules as before, so an `ACTIVE`
  definition can again be disabled or copied from the UI. Any `DRAFT` is now promotable (a
  standalone draft is activated in place), and *Export YAML* downloads the definition in the
  exact shape the git/classpath importers read back.
- **Definition-level guardrails against runaway loops.** `WorkflowDefinition.checkInvariants()`
  now rejects precondition cycles (a step waits for its `preconditionStepId` to complete, so a
  cycle deadlocks; the error names the cycle), and the model and JSON schema gain per-step
  execution caps — `Step.maxSuccessfulExecutions` and
  `WorkflowDefinition.defaultMaxStepExecutions` (`0` = inherit/unbounded) — carried through
  working copies, imports and persistence, to be enforced when step re-execution lands.

### Changed
- **BREAKING: the execution model is now pure dataflow.** A step starts when it is `CREATED`,
  ALL its preconditions have `COMPLETED` and its `preconditionExpression` is truthy — and
  every eligible step starts **concurrently**. The old scheduling semantics are gone: array
  order no longer matters, an active step no longer serializes independent chains, and
  `parallel: true` no longer opts into concurrency — the flag is **deprecated and ignored**
  (it still deserializes, so persisted stepJson and old files keep loading, but it has no
  effect). Parallelism is expressed structurally: shared preconditions fan out (`FORK` makes
  it explicit), multiple preconditions form a barrier (`JOIN`).
- **BREAKING: roots rule — every flow must enter through a `START` or `WAIT_FOR_MESSAGE`.**
  A step with no preconditions must be one of those two types; definitions violating this are
  rejected at load (and by the Maven plugin at build time). Migration: add one `START` step
  and point your old first steps at it; anchor compensation steps to the step they compensate
  with `"preconditionExpression": "false"` (the compensation pipeline starts them directly,
  ignoring the guard).
- **BREAKING: `MESSAGE` step type renamed to `WAIT_FOR_MESSAGE`, and `correlationExpression`
  is now required on both message step types.** New or reimported definitions must use the
  new name and declare `correlationExpression` explicitly — the old defaults-to-`businessKey`
  behavior is gone; add `"correlationExpression": "businessKey"` to keep it. A legacy
  deserialization alias keeps old persisted stepJson and definition files loading (`MESSAGE`
  maps to `WAIT_FOR_MESSAGE`, and those legacy steps retain the businessKey fallback), so
  in-flight processes survive the upgrade. To support the idiom, `businessKey` is now seeded
  as a plain variable into every JEXL evaluation context (correlation **and** precondition
  expressions) — property access such as `process.businessKey` was never evaluable, because
  the JEXL engine deliberately runs with `RESTRICTED` permissions on untrusted expressions.
- **Upgraded Mateu to `3.0-alpha.271`.** `3.0-alpha.271` is a breaking release that removed the
  UI CRUD API (`CrudRepository`, `CrudAdapter`, `CrudEditorForm`, `CrudCreationForm`,
  `ListingBackend`, the `core.infra.declarative.Listing` base and `AutoNamedView`) and split
  `Searchable` into a marker interface plus a new `SearchableText`. The admin-UI layer of all
  engines was migrated:
  - `CrudRepository` → `CrudStore` (the method set is unchanged) across ~24 ports/pages/adapters.
  - Pages whose detail view differs from the row (`Processes` → `SimpleProcessViewModel`,
    `WorkflowDefinitions` → `WorkflowDefinitionDetailView`) and the read-only `Tasks` listing now
    extend `Crud<View, …>` directly instead of `AutoCrud`/`FilteredAutoCrud` (which pin
    `View = Row`), because `Navigable.view()` is now generically typed.
  - `rule-engine` was pinned to Mateu `3.0-alpha.222`; it now tracks `${mateu.version}` like the
    rest of the reactor.
  - In the demo services (booking, content, control-plane, shell, users) the `CrudAdapter` layer
    was dissolved into the crud itself: every crud now implements the whole lifecycle
    (`search(SearchRequest)`, `view`, `edit`, `creationForm`, `save`, `create`, `deleteAllById`)
    in a single `Crud`/`AutoCrud`/`FilteredAutoCrud` subclass, and the demo `*CrudAdapter`
    classes were deleted. The workflow engine keeps its adapters (`SimpleProcessCrudAdapter`,
    `StepExecutionsCrudAdapter` and the process child-crud adapters) as collaborators of the
    migrated pages.
  - Testbench UI apps declare `spring-boot-starter-webmvc` explicitly: the Mateu MVC annotation
    processor now generates SSE-capable controllers and the engines only carry the starter as
    `optional`.
  - Everything builds against the released `3.0-alpha.271` — the engine reactor and the
    standalone demo and testbench apps (which have their own poms outside the reactor) alike.
- **The Workflow Definitions admin page is now read-only** (list + rich detail view). Definitions
  are authored as YAML and loaded from the classpath, Git or the database, and were never created
  or edited from this page; the write actions are disabled rather than reimplemented on the new
  API.

### Removed
- Dead `ProcessCrudAdapter` (superseded by `SimpleProcessCrudAdapter`; only referenced by an
  unused import) was deleted as part of the Mateu 271 migration.

### Fixed
- **`END` no longer records co-eligible sibling steps as `COMPLETED` without running them.**
  When an `END` became eligible in the same transition as another executable step, that step
  was silently marked `COMPLETED` even though it never ran; it is now `CANCELLED` like every
  other in-flight step the `END` terminates.
- **`MessageReceived` was missing from `DomainEvent`'s `@JsonSubTypes`**, so a raw
  `message-received` event published on the Kafka `upstream` topic could not be deserialized.
  It is now registered as `message-received`.
- **Startup failure on databases with existing workflow definitions**: the new NOT NULL
  `default_max_step_executions` column could not be added by `ddl-auto=update` (Postgres rejects
  it without a default). `@ColumnDefault("0")` fixes Hibernate-managed schemas and a V4 Flyway
  migration covers Flyway-managed deployments; `0` = unbounded.
- **Process detail view**: explicit tab names keep *steps*, *log*, *errors* and *resources* as
  separate tabs (consecutive bare `@Tab` fields now merge into one tab in Mateu), and
  `CreateProcessForm` marks the form clean on create — creating *is* the save, so no
  "save before leaving?" prompt.
- **Workflow definition editor**: removed the backward-compatible `WorkflowDefinition`/`Step`
  constructors that made Mateu's `ReflectionInstanceFactory` build empty objects on save
  (`name=null`, `steps=[]`), and the precondition/compensation step lookups now exclude the step
  being edited, so a step can no longer be offered as its own precondition or compensation.

## [1.0-beta.010] - 2026-07-24

### Fixed
- **Kafka broker resilience.**
  - Corrected the default Kafka broker address to `localhost:9092` (was a `9192` typo), so
    a standalone app started from the IDE without `KAFKA_BROKERS` set connects to the local
    dev broker instead of rebootstrapping in an endless loop.
  - Standalone apps now **boot gracefully when the broker is unavailable at startup**. The
    Spring Cloud Stream binder's provisioning/admin timeouts are bounded and binding retry
    is enabled, so the context no longer blocks ~2 minutes (and loses its AdminClient) — it
    starts promptly and binds its consumers as soon as the broker is up.

### Added
- **Distributed chaos tests for Kafka broker outages** (`workflow-dist-e2e`): a process
  recovers when the broker disappears mid-flight and returns — driven by the transactional
  outbox (DIST-06) — and the orchestrator boots and processes normally when the broker is
  unavailable at startup and later returns (DIST-07).

## [1.0-beta.009] - 2026-07-23

### Added
- **Workflow definition lifecycle management** in the admin UI. Definitions move
  through `DRAFT` → `ACTIVE` → `DISABLED` → `ARCHIVED` with per-status toolbar
  actions: *Promote to production* (working copies only), *Create working copy*,
  *Disable*/*Enable*, *Archive* and *Reactivate*. An `ACTIVE` definition is
  read-only (edited through a working copy) and must be disabled before it can be
  archived; *Reactivate* returns an archived definition to `DRAFT`. New
  definitions are created as `DRAFT` and the status is never editable. Documented
  with a state diagram in `/guides/workflow-definitions`.
- EventConductor now **owns the workflow graph component** (moved out of mateu),
  served as a self-contained web component from the engine jar.

### Changed
- **Migrated to Spring Boot 4** (from 3.5): starter/autoconfig relocations,
  Jackson 3, Spring Cloud 2025.1, Spring AI 2.0 and networknt
  json-schema-validator 3.0.
- Adopted **mateu 3.0-alpha.263** (new `CrudStore` API). This brings the UI
  behaviour the lifecycle work relies on: the top navigation renders as a Vaadin
  menu-bar, an intermediate menu route (e.g. `/workflow`) shows a section index
  instead of "Not found", and the built-in *Edit* action is hidden on `ACTIVE`
  definitions.
- Coordinated **gRPC 1.83.0 + protobuf 4.35.1** bump; commons-jexl3 3.7.0; and
  Spring Cloud dependency updates.

## [1.0-beta.008] - 2026-07-17

### Added
- `workflow-maven-plugin`: a Maven plugin (goal `eventconductor:validate`, bound
  to `process-resources`) that validates workflow, form and rule definitions
  (JSON/YAML) against the engine's published specifications at build time and
  fails the build on any violation. It bundles the canonical schemas straight
  from the sibling engine modules so it can never drift, and adds the semantic
  checks a schema cannot express: workflow duplicate/dangling/self-referencing
  step references, cron-expression validity and JEXL parseability of
  preconditions; decision-table row arity and JEXL parseability of rule
  expressions. Configurable directories, per-type toggles, `failOnError`,
  `failOnMissing` and `skip`.

## [1.0-beta.007] - 2026-07-16

### Added
- `RULE` step type backed by a new rule-engine catalog and embeddable
  rule-runtime: a step references a `ruleId` and the engine dispatches it for
  evaluation.
- Forms **Tasks v2**: the pending-tasks listing renders the completion form
  inline in each row, with an optimized query behind it.
- `TIMER` step type: durably pauses a process for an ISO 8601 duration
  (`duration: "PT72H"`) or until an absolute date taken from a process variable
  (`untilVariable`), fired by the timeout scheduler in both memory and JPA modes.
- `MESSAGE` step type with correlation: a step waits (durably, dispatching no
  task) for a `MessageReceived` correlated by the process `businessKey` or a
  `correlationExpression`; the message variables merge into the process.
- Cron-scheduled process starts: a definition can declare a `cronExpression`
  and the engine creates instances at each occurrence with deterministic
  business keys so multiple pods never duplicate an occurrence. New
  `workflow.cron-scan-interval-ms` and `workflow.cron-enabled` properties.
- Built-in process analytics (`ProcessAnalyticsService`): per definition and
  time window, instance counts by status, completion/error/cancellation rates,
  throughput per day and average/p95 durations per process and per step with a
  bottleneck flag — in all deployment modes. Surfaced in an **Analytics** UI
  page and the `getWorkflowAnalytics` / `findBottleneck` MCP tools. Step
  executions record `finishedAt` on terminal status (Flyway `V3`).
- Public test specification ([TESTING.md](./TESTING.md)) and the matching
  suites: an embedded/JPA end-to-end suite (`workflow-e2e`) covering
  orchestration semantics, failure handling, timers, message correlation,
  cron starts, idempotency, the JEXL sandbox and analytics; a JPA durability
  suite driving the real outbox relay and JDBC advisory locks on H2; a
  single-JVM crash-recovery test; and a Docker-gated distributed suite
  (`workflow-dist-e2e`, `dist-e2e` profile) over real Kafka + PostgreSQL via
  Testcontainers — distributed happy path, crash recovery, two-pod dispatch
  exclusivity, worker-crash redelivery and a 500-instance load smoke.

### Changed
- Bumped the Mateu UI dependency to `3.0-alpha.243` and centralized it as a
  `mateu.version` property.

### Fixed
- A process whose step exhausted its retries is now reported as `ERROR`
  instead of being falsely marked `COMPLETED`, and successors of a failed
  step no longer run.
- Precondition (JEXL) expressions are evaluated in a sandbox
  (`JexlPermissions.RESTRICTED`, blocking reflection and system access) and
  now fail closed — an evaluation error means the guarded step does not run.
- Outbox relays publish before marking a message `Sent` (at-least-once);
  messages that cannot be loaded are parked as `Error` rather than retried
  forever, and message types are validated against an `io.mateu.*` allowlist.
- Process creation deduplicates by `businessKey`, so a redelivered creation
  event no longer creates a duplicate process.
- Cancellation marks the process `CANCELLED` first so the orchestration loop
  cannot dispatch new steps mid-cancellation, and late worker reports for
  steps already in a terminal state are ignored.
- Step timeouts now fire in memory-persistence mode, not only in JPA mode.
- Definition validation rejects duplicate step ids and dangling
  `preconditionStepId` / `compensationStepId` references.
- Relay and scheduler threads are daemon threads with configurable poll
  intervals.

## [1.0-beta.006] - 2026-07-02

### Added
- Spring Boot Actuator with Prometheus, health, and info endpoints in
  `workflow-engine` and `forms-engine`.
- Custom Micrometer metrics for processes by status, step executions and
  retries.
- Spring Security with HTTP Basic on REST endpoints, configurable via
  application properties. Actuator health/info remain public.
- Flyway migrations for the workflow and forms schemas. Default `ddl-auto`
  is now `validate` in production profiles.
- Logstash-encoder structured JSON logging via `application-prod.yaml`.
- LICENSE (MIT), SECURITY.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md and
  CHANGELOG.md.
- Dependabot configuration for Maven, GitHub Actions, Docker and npm.
- Build status, CodeQL and license badges in the README.
- Helm chart hardening: external secrets, NetworkPolicy, PodDisruptionBudget,
  Ingress template and Actuator-based probes.
- New PR CI workflow that runs `mvn verify` (unit + integration tests +
  JaCoCo coverage check) and Trivy container scans.
- Renamed misspelled `buid-and-publish.yml` to `build-and-publish.yml` and
  enabled running the test suite during release builds.

### Changed
- `workflow.mode` now defaults to `embedded` (previously `kafka`), mirroring
  `workflow.persistence` which defaults to `memory`. Apps start fully
  in-process with no external dependencies and opt into JPA/Kafka as they
  scale. The standalone distributed apps set `kafka`/`jpa` explicitly.
- Bumped the Mateu UI dependency to `3.0-alpha.222`.
- Dockerfiles run as a non-root `app` user (UID 10001).
- `docker-compose.yml` split into `docker-compose.dev.yml` (with default
  passwords) and `docker-compose.yml` (with required env vars).

### Fixed
- Quote the reserved SQL column `values` in `FormExecutionEntity` so schema
  creation succeeds on H2 and PostgreSQL.

### Security
- All REST endpoints in the orchestrator and forms standalone apps now
  require authentication by default.
- Bumped Eclipse JGit to `6.10.1.202505221210-r` to fix the XXE vulnerability
  CVE-2025-4949 (GHSA-vrpq-qp53-qv56).
