/**
 * Correlates an incoming {@code MessageReceived} against WAIT_FOR_MESSAGE steps waiting for
 * it. A step matches when it is PENDING on the same messageName and its correlation key (from
 * the step's correlationExpression; businessKey only for pre-rename persisted steps) equals the
 * message's. Both are materialised on the step execution and kept current as the process
 * changes, so this is an indexed lookup rather than a walk over every step waiting anywhere in
 * the engine — with many processes parked on the same message name, that walk was the cost of
 * every single message.
 *
 * <p>Matches are completed by {@link CompleteMessageStepHandler} under the process lock, which
 * re-evaluates the correlation from the live process before acting: this query is the filter,
 * that check is the decision. A message that matches no waiting step is ignored (logged, not
 * buffered): upstream delivery is at-least-once, so the sender simply retries once the process
 * is waiting.
