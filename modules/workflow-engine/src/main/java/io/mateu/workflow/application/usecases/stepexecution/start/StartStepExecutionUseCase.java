        // relay, the broker — is queueing, and charging it to the step's timeout is what turns a
        // backlog into failures: once the dispatch backlog exceeds the timeout, steps expire
        // before any worker has seen them, the retries go with them, and their sagas roll back.

        // `timeout` is "Maximum execution time" in the definition schema, and
        // `eventconductor.step.duration` is "from dispatch to final status" in the observability
        // reference. Both derive from startedAt, so moving it here makes both of them so.
        //
        // The engine already holds this principle elsewhere: pausing a process shifts startedAt by
        // the pause duration, precisely so that time a step could not be running does not count
        // against it. Queue time is the same thing, and was the case left out.
