/**
 * <p>The indexes are declared here as well as in the Flyway migrations, and that duplication is
 * deliberate. A schema created by {@code ddl-auto} — which is what the embedded path and every
 * test harness use — gets tables from the entities and nothing from the migrations, so without
 * this the engine runs with primary keys only. Every deadline scan, outbox claim and correlation
 * lookup then becomes a sequential scan, and the queries this engine was built around stop being
 * lookups at all. Measured on a cluster where they were missing: PostgreSQL pinned at 750m of CPU
 * and throughput down from tens of process instances a second to about one.
