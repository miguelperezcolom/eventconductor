/**
 * The held half of a named per-key lock: one row per {@code (lockName, lockKey)} that is currently
 * owned. Its primary key <b>is</b> the mutex — the composite key is materialised into {@link #id}
 * ({@code lockName + '\0' + lockKey}) so a would-be second holder simply fails the insert.
 *
 * <p>Declared as an entity so {@code ddl-auto} creates the table for the embedded path and every
 * test harness; the same shape is created by Flyway {@code V29} for deployments that run migrations
 * instead — the two must agree. See {@code JdbcLockService} for the acquire/release protocol and
 * {@code LOCK-SERIALIZATION-PLAN.md} for the design.
