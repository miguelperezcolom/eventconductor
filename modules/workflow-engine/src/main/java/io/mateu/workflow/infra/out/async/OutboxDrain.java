/**
 * Drains a bounded batch of pending outbox messages, claiming them with row locks so any number
 * of pods can relay at once without electing a leader between them.
 *
 * <p>Each pass is one transaction: claim ids (skipping what other pods hold), deliver, mark the
 * batch Sent, commit. Delivery happens <b>before</b> the rows are marked, and a crash anywhere in
 * between rolls the transaction back and releases the locks, so another pod redelivers — the
 * at-least-once contract the relay always had, unchanged. Marking first would lose messages.
 *
 * <p>That ordering is necessary and was not sufficient. It only means anything if a delivery that
 * fails <em>says so</em>, and for a long time it could not: the send was asynchronous and its
 * return value discarded, so a broker that was down still produced a row marked Sent. During a
 * ninety-second broker outage, 71 of 642 912 messages were lost that way. The publisher now
 * throws when the broker refuses, which lands in the catch below and leaves the row Pending —
 * and the applications configure the producer synchronously so that refusal is knowable at all.
 *
 * <p>The batch is bounded for a reason beyond memory: the claim holds row locks for as long as
 * the transaction runs, so the batch size is really a bound on how long other pods can be kept
 * from those rows.
 *
 * <h2>The ack barrier</h2>
 *
 * <p>Synchronous sends are what make a refusal knowable, and doing them one after another is what
 * made the batch cost messages × round trip on a single relay thread. Those are separable. The
 * batch is split by partition key: a key's messages go in order, different keys go at once, and
 * the pass returns only when all of them have finished. Nothing about the delivery contract moves
 * — each send still blocks, still throws when refused, still leaves its own row Pending — but the
 * acks are awaited together, so the batch costs the slowest group rather than the sum, and the
 * producer can batch concurrent records into far fewer broker requests.
 *
 * <p>Splitting by key is what makes it safe rather than merely fast: two events of one process are
 * never in flight together, which is the ordering that keying events by process exists to give.
 * Concurrency is 1 by default, so this is opt-in until a cluster measurement says otherwise.
