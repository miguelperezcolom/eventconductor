/**
 * Publishes committed outbox messages to Kafka.
 *
 * <p><b>Every pod relays.</b> Batches are claimed with row locks that skip what other pods hold
 * (see {@link OutboxDrain}), so N orchestrators drain N disjoint slices and relay throughput
 * grows with the cluster. This used to be a leader-elected singleton: one pod drained the whole
 * outbox while the rest idled, which put a ceiling on the distributed topology that adding pods
 * could not lift — every state transition in kafka mode passes through here.
 *
 * <p>The loop does not simply sleep between passes: it waits on {@link OutboxSignal}, which the
 * pod raises after committing a write of its own. The poll interval becomes a fallback for rows
 * written by other pods rather than the latency every step pays — measured on the benchmark
 * harness, that wait was about half the cost of a transition.
 *
 * <p>A pass that comes back with a full batch means more is waiting, so the loop keeps draining
 * until it does not — otherwise throughput would be capped at one batch per poll interval, and a
 * backlog would take as many intervals as it has batches. It stops early if a full batch settles
 * nothing, so messages that always fail cannot spin the loop.
 *
 * <p><b>When the broker refuses, the relay backs off.</b> Stopping the inner loop early is not
 * enough on its own: the outer loop waits on the signal, every commit raises it, and a commit does
 * not mean the broker has come back — so a pod under load with a broker down retried at the rate it
 * was writing, not at any configured interval. A pass that claims rows and settles none of them is
 * now paced by {@link RelayPace} instead, which ignores the signal while it waits. See that class
 * for what counts as a stall and why the cap is seconds.
