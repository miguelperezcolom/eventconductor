/**
 * Sends a task to the destination its step names.
 *
 * <p>A step's {@code topic} is the binding this sends on, and a step that names none goes to
 * {@code downstream} — the single destination everything used to go to, and the one the engine
 * contributes a binding for. A topic that has no binding of its own is a dynamic destination:
 * Spring Cloud Stream creates it on first use, so a definition can name a worker pool without the
 * application declaring anything, and it inherits the producer defaults (including
 * {@code sync=true}, without which the accepted/refused answer {@link PartitionedEvents} checks
 * would be meaningless).
